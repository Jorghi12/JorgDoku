I remember listening to Penguin Cafe Orchestra while studying for my
SAT's back in high school. Their music was the perfect blend of
classical with a modern catchy twist. Only recently have I been
listening to Avici's "Fade into Darkness", which is an electopop remix
of the song. Maybe I'll post that song later as well. But back to the
original, let's listen to the music that lead to it's inspiration and
conception. For me in the past as well as for everyone else. Music is
universal and can transcend barriers in a profound way, ergo Penguin
Cafe Orchestra.
