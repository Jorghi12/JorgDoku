**Wushu Concept Photoshoot - Melvin Hseih (High Key)**



So I've had some photoshoot ideas on my mind ever since this spring
quarter. These ideas usually start out as small conceptual bookmarks
that I make while going through my daily routine. I'll be looking
through a photoblog or magazine and something will click. Melvin is a
good friend of mine. I think we met last year while I was still trying
out wushu. We also had some classes together and became
more acquainted as I've gotten more involved in TASA as well. But he
asked me to help him out with a photoshoot and so I thought it would be
awesome if he could display some of his wushu on camera for me. This is
one of two concepts that I wanted to do, the first being high key and
more traditional, while the second is more low key and a little more
dramatic. Hope you like, the low key photos will be coming out soon!
