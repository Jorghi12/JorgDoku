`via <None>`__

This song has been played incessantly over the past few weeks. Don't
worry, I'm not bothering anyone, because I always wear headphones. My
itunes has logged 250 accounts, which is slightly embarrassing. I've
decided to use this song as my 詩的闡釋 (Poetry Interpretation), for
Chinese. And although I'm not a native chinese speaker, I feel like I've
started to understand the lyrics on a pretty good level. The artist,
**方大同 (Khalil Fong)** who Michelle introduced me to last year,
composes such versed and masterful lyrics (although my understanding of
the breadth of chinese poetry is pretty bad. 



The composer is describing the life and essence of a girl 蘇麗珍 (Su Li
Zhen). Her name, being described by the individual characters means
(**蘇**\ Revive, **麗**\ Beautiful and **珍**\ Treasure). You start to
see these characteristics become interwoven into the description as well
as the forces of life provoking the main theme.



Reading through the lyrics at first, the situation feels heavy albeit
the upbeat poppy rhythm. But after reading through it several times, the
contrast in the difficult mood is mixed with a joyous sigh of relief.
The mixing of emotion and opposite natures is what is soo good about the
lyrics.



The body is the structure and becomes the backbone for his style, which
make the poem kind of difficult to read or understand. The characters
are placed very strategically in a prosaic meter. The rhyme scheme and
stress patterns surround the syllable nucleus of the vowel sound "o"
like 如\ **果**\ ，錯\ **過**\ ，寂\ **寞**\ ，幽\ **默**\ ，閃\ **躲**
(ru**guô**, cuo\ **guò**, you\ **mò**, shan\ **duô**), while these
states are used in forms that contrast each other like 不說，囉唆
 (Don't talk, talk too much), 快樂的寂寞 (happiness of loneliness),
就是\ **對** 還是\ **錯** (exactly correct but still wrong). 



There are several levels of complexity, each dealing with a specific
aspect of life, love, and the way we understand our state of happiness
and fulfillment. Lizhen's life is in a constant state of if, then,
repeat, miss and then repeat. The main character is trying to persuade
her to take a glance at herself, to show her that her point of view is
in a state of dissonance, happy yet sad, beautiful yet difficult. Her
life is a never-ending story, her fear is the ending. Yet ironically,
the song is the ending, it is point of confrontation that her fears
surround. The song is that point of thematic climax, and the listener is
left wondering if anything happens.



The composer and lizhen are put on stage, a dance of wits. He makes a
move, she dodges and evades. She rebuts his claims, and he rebounds. She
explains her happiness, she explains her style of life and it's beauty.
It comes to the stage, where their shadows have been left bare and
everything has been laid down. They're both in a state of vulnerability,
and it comes to this point, where she might miss it again.



But things aren't as simple as it seems. Even though everything appears
to be right, it might be wrong. Having all the characteristics of love,
the state of love can still be loneliness. She thinks about it too much.
She mulls over the situation in her mind while never talking about it.
She's afraid of disappointment, that her expectations will not be
matched, that his expectations are different. In a way, their
expectations might miss each other. 



**Is it right? Is it wrong? Who is right? Who is wrong?**



The composer collects his thoughts and makes his final move. At this
point, the song ends with a sigh of relief. All the pieces are on the
field, and it's Lizhen's turn.



Thanks for everyone who helped me with this project! Harrison, Tina,
Nancy and Virginia. Talking to you guys about it gave me more insight. I
wrote down the characters over a thousand times, but it was hard
interpreting the whole body of work by just the characters. But after
spending soo much time, I started to appreciate the poetry on a deeper
level. Each level of complexity, deriving from the strokes into the
radicals, character, to the words and then the phrases; each phrase
being modeled from the pieces interwoven into the stanza and then the
poem. I guess I still have a lot to learn.
