`via <None>`__

There's nothing more revolutionary than two people loving each other.
It's soo uncommon these days, and soo hard to do. In more than one way,
when we offer Gift-love, we die. The true archetype for which all love
strives is manifest in form of which Jesus died, for so he loved the
world.



    

    | **For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses
    his life for my sake will save it.**
    | *Luke 9:24*

    



| John 6:16-21
| 2 Corinthians 12:7
| Matthew 27:51-55
| Mark 15:16-21 



    

    | 
    | See the stone set in your eyes
    | See the thorn twist in your side.
    | I wait for you.
    | Sleight of hand and twist of fate
    | On a bed of nails she makes me wait
    | And I wait without you
    | With or without you
    | With or without you.
    | Through the storm, we reach the shore
    | You gave it all but I want more
    | And I'm waiting for you
    | With or without you
    | With or without you.
    | I can't live with or without you.
    | And you give yourself away
    | And you give yourself away
    | And you give, and you give
    | And you give yourself away.
    | My hands are tied, my body bruised
    | She´s got me with nothing to win
    | And nothing left to lose.
    | And you give yourself away
    | And you give yourself away
    | And you give, and you give
    | And you give yourself away.
    | With or without you
    | With or without you
    | I can't live
    | With or without you.
