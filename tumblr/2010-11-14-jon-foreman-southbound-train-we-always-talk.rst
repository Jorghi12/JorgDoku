Jon Foreman - Southbound Train



**We always talk about finding new places and dream of new destinations,
but, what is a goal if you forgot where you started.**



**Please, come back home.**



| I'm headed home
| Yeah, but I'm not so sure
| That home is a place you 
| Can still get to by train
| So I'm looking out the window
| And I'm drifting off to sleep
| With my face pressed up 
| Against the pane
| With the rhythm of my heart
| And my sleepy girl's breathing
| With the rhythm 
| Of the southbound train
| Oh, well the wind starts 
| To look like her hair
| And the sun 
| And her bright blue eyes
| As the sea 
| And the shore fall and rise
| Like her breast 
| As she breathes by my side
| And the moon is her lips
| And the sun is headed 
| On down to the sea
| Like her hair 
| As she lays down on me
| Until we reach ocean side
| Over and over 
| I hear the same train
| With the rhythm of my heart
| And my sleepy girl's breathing
| With the rhythm 
| Of my southbound train
| Oh, I suppose 
| They'll say I should've known
| Or maybe I'm just feeling old
| Like a lawyer with no one to blame
| I'm headed home
| Yeah, but I'm not so sure
| Home is a place 
| That'll ever look the same
| So we gather up our things
| And we head out in the cold
| And your eyes 
| Are where you carry the pain
| And I hear the whistle weeping
| It's crying to the skying
| It's the rhythm 
| Of the southbound train
| It's the rhythm 
| Of my southbound train
