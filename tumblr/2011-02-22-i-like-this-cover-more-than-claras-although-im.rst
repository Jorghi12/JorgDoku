I like this cover more than Clara's, although I'm definitely excited to
see her in April.



| Been trying not to be conned, by your sleight of hand
| Been trying not to be tricked, by your sleight of hand
| But you smile, then you prowl
| Then you go for the kill
| Just to keep me nearsighted
| Your waves they are holding
| My head by its mouthpiece
| Peace flows through my veins
| 'Cause I know
| I'll come up for a breath
| So wait on me
| Wait on me
| Da da da da dum da ruh dum
| La ra da ra dum duh dum 
| Wait I'm being tossed to and fro
| But I'll be a polished stone
| Gemstone
| I, I've been broken in
| But I sure ain't been broken down
| I, I've been broken in
| But I sure ain't been broken down
| And you open my eyes
