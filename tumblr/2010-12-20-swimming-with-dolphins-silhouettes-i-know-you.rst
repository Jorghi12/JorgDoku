**Swimming with Dolphins - Silhouettes**



| I know you won't admit this
| I am just a silhouette to you
| You found comfort with my distance
| But you never let me stray out of your view
| Who really needs the past
| With the allure of something new
| So we split apart at last
| Went back to places that I knew
| Before you
| And you never have to see
| The light that wraps itself around me
| And I never have to know
| The faces there
| The places you go
| The places you go
| When I count by the resistance
| I bend in shapes in ways I never knew
| So I'll try to post from my existence
| Yeah I'll stop or start my heart if you ask me to
| I'll stop my heart and then I'll wait for you
| I was sure I never would be sure we were in love
| (Although it's dark and black)
| I am sure I never would be sure of love to come
| (There is one thing left to hold on to)
| After you
| And you never have to see
| The light that wraps itself around me
| And I never have to know
| The faces there
| The places you go
| The places you go
