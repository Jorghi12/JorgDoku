My greatest resource is \ **time**, and I allocate it the way I wish.



| **Meaning:
**\ I enjoy studying for my classes. But,
| my GPA is subpar.
| I don't sleep very often. But,
| I dream the life I live.



| I exercise on my spare time. But
| pig out on a daily basis.
| I'll never meet you half way. Because
| I'll try to go the distance.



| I have nothing to lose. Although
| Time is my greatest resource.
| I give it to other people. So
| That it never goes to waste.
