**Let me introduce you to Candice and Jenny.** They're both learning how
to play a game I've chosen for them. I've given them some guidelines to
read as well as a test of their understanding. **They both read over the
paragraph below, but strangely, this is what Jenny see's.**



    

    Xxx game xxx xx played xx two, three xx four players, xxx additional
    rules xxxx xxx solo and four-player partnership xxxx. Each player

    turn, although xxxxx multiple games xxx played xx xx common practice
    xxx xxx first turn xx rotate clockwise around xxx board xx
    subsequent xxxxx.

    



Reading the description of the game, they start to take the test as
follows.



| 1) How many players are allowed to play the game?
| 2) What determines who gets the first turn?
| 3) What shape is the board compiled of?



No, Jenny doesn't have a reading problem. But in fact, **she's a dumb
genius**. This is what Candice saw.



    

    The game can be played by two, three or four players, with
    additional rules provided for solo and four-player partnership play.
    Each player has a rack of six randomly-chosen tiles which are
    concealed from the other players. The board is also made up of a
    number of hexagons, with the two outermost rings reserved for three-
    and four-player games respectively. The rules state that the
    youngest player takes the first turn, although where multiple games
    are played it is common practice for the first turn to rotate
    clockwise around the board in subsequent games.

    



After taking the exam, both girls are quite intelligent and score 100%.
**However Candice spends the whole weekend on the test, while Jenny goes
out to the movies. **\ Interestingly, Jenny performs as well as Candice
despite her dyslexic inattention to detail.



But I don't think any of you had a problem answering the problems with
Jenny's version, despite taking only fraction of the time reading
it. The key is quickly overlooking the clutter, and choosing the
important details. **Although this is just a silly variant of a game, it
becomes deep once the rules no longer depict a board game, and becomes
replaced with our own lives.**



Many of us choose to read the whole article for the sake of accuracy and
precision. **However, our desires for completeness undermines the
ambition set for our performance.** Albeit Candice's weekends effort,
her mind is overloaded with unnecessary information.



Now lets place the dice at a higher level. Not only for board games, but
difficult college courses, reading e-mails, complex literature and
interpersonal relationships.\ ** It's not recklessness, it's not
inattention or disregard of detail. It's what we call a genius.**\ While
we all search for the needle in a haystack, it is the reckless who
search the whole haystack. The genius knows where to search first. Great
speakers know the right words, great musicians know the right notes and
great students don't read the whole textbook.



**Maybe it's time that we all become more like Genius Jenny rather than
Candid Candice.** What we have been taught about working hard should be
replaced with a mantra of working smart. Because Jenny got to go to the
movies, and she's probably happier that way.
