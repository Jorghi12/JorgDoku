I had a very particular dream last night. I met up with a friend who is
no longer here. It was just like the old days, and we just carried on
with our last conversation, as if we were still there at that time. It
stirred up old feelings which I had left ridden in the dust of my past
years. I embraced the nostalgia.



However, like any other dream. You wake up, and thats what happened. I
woke up, and it was today. But unlike expectations, I wasn't sad that it
was just a dream and not reality. In fact, I was happy. I was happy to
know that I had lived for a time, and I still have much to live for.
These memories make each day much more meaningful, and the memories to
come make each day worth looking foreword to.



But at the same time, I miss you very much. I wonder when will be the
next time, we will be able to have a conversation like this.
