Photography is about capturing the essence within a moment in time.
Painted with light upon a canvas through a prism of glass, a
photographer works his mastery of these elements to tell a story.



Although all is said which can be said. The longer I embark into
photography, the more I realize my inexperience. Not only in the
technicalities, but in simple creativity and vision, the bread and
butter, have become of a most complex task.



So here is a small compilation of photos from some of my photographic
role models. Some people whose interaction and inspiration has led me to
pursue this field with more passion.
