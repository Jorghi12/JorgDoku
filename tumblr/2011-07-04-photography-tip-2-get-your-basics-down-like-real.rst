A lot of people get fascinated with photography because it is directly
linked to all the beautiful things that we see in the world. We wish to
capture these snapshots and share them with others as well as into the
future. Many of the greats in photography have always talked about their
cameras as being an extension of their own eye. In a sense, that is how
we wish to perceive our cameras. However, unlike our own eyes that don't
require any semblance of tweaking, cameras are machines which we have to
control. And because of this, in order to get the creative composition
and control to take the picture, we have to understand the way our
camera works, in and out, forewords and backwards and to the moon if
that is required. 



So if you have a camera, **LEARN HOW IT WORKS.** I can't emphasize this
enough. It is distressing to see people with professional quality
equipment on automatic mode.



The first thing you need to learn is something called **Exposure.** In a
sense, exposure is exactly what it sounds like. The camera opens up it's
shutter for a moment of time, the light travels through a hole and is
captured by the sensor. Unlike our eyes, a camera only captures one
exposure and the amount of light which the camera has captured is called
the exposure. There are three ways that we can adjust for this exposure,
and they are called **Shutter Speed, Aperture and ISO.** You need to
understand these three in and out. I won't write out a tutorial on these
three myself, because so many people have done so in such a better way
than I ever could. But here is a graph and videos where you can get
started.

Canon actually has a great video series which teaches you how to control
these three settings and how they are used differently in different
effects. You can find these videos and more taught by Chris Bay, an
amazing and succinct teacher, at this site.

I actually watched these videos several times last year when I started
getting into photography, and they are a great resource and worth every
bit of time. Once you get these three key elements down, you can really
start to understand how light works through these settings. Once you
start to master exposure, you can really start to grasp more advanced
techniques in **MANUAL MODE.**

However, you will not be able to spend a day learning these 3
components. You really need to get your hands on some projects and take
some pictures yourself. By really experiencing the effects of changing
exposure manually will you really start to become a better photographer.
So get yourself out of automatic mode and switch over to manual. Taking
control of exposure yourself is really the only way to take pictures.
