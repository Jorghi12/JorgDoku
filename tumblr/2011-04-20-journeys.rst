So looking back at these 4 years, I reminisce.



Each person traverses a path laid out by their circumstance, made their
own completely separate and unique experience. Recounting, as for only a
wisp of time we share in a casual encounter. Listening to stories of how
we got here and where we wish to go. I've realized, for a moment, we all
share in this same space. But soon we will depart as life's natural
trajectory unfolds a bittersweet departure.



**But WOW, I have had an amazing experience sharing this time with
you!**
