Looking foreword to this event for a long time. Got to photograph some
youtube stars and met them at the end of the concert. Clara Chung, Sam
Hart and Marie Digby were all awesome. I really love Clara's voice and
she's super nice in person to. I think a lot of people came to see Marie
Digby, and she was really down to earth and quirky. At the end of the
concert, she played an encore of Rhianna's umbrella and we got to go up
and sing and dance with her. Sam Hart was really chill and played a lot
of emo songs.
