As I get ready to go to bed, something interesting occurs. It's soo
interesting that I spend the whole night on it.



| It could be a good conversation.
| It could be an interesting article.
| It could be the class I'm studying for.
| It could be a long tumblr post.



At the end of the night and as morning starts, I ask myself, was all
that time worth it? Is this normal? Am I crazy?



| I think for a little bit and eventually come to the conclusion
| ...\ **No.**\ crazy people are the ones who **wouldn't**Â do this.



I then proceed to bed.
