**Nobel Laureates and Such**



Studying during 10th week is pretty demoralizing. Sometimes it's hard to
find purpose in the final grind. But looking at the big picture, I'm
really fortunate to study here. In the past couple weeks, I got the
chance to spend time and photograph some pretty distinguished faculty.
Listening to their stories, and to see where they are gives me a hope at
what is to come. Of course, most of us aren't likely to to achieve
anything like a nobel prize. But we can all dream big.
