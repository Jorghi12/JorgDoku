**Give me some of your time, I know this post is long.**



Sit down with me as I talk about something we can all relate to.



**The ending moments of a relationship, as described by the Fray.**



I never really liked this song, it was too poppy and mainstream for me
to care enough about it. However, I was at Starbucks the other day
trying to find an excuse from my MCAT reading, and this song started to
play on the radio. **Listening a little more closely to the lyrics, I
realized The Fray was telling an amazing poetic story, so I immediately
found respect for it.** 



Here are my interpretations of the song lyrics. Even if they are
different than what was intended, I think this is something we can all
relate to.



***Allow me to walk you through this story!***



In the beginning, he introduces the two characters; two lovers in the
moment of a life changing quarrel. The guy states the proverbial **"*We
need to talk",*** as they walk into his car. You know it's his car,
because it later states *"**Some sort of window to your right, As he
goes left and you stay right***\ **".** At this point, they enter the
car, she goes in the passenger seat by **"staying right"** and he goes
into the driver "**As he goes left"**. The window to her right is the
passenger seat window".



***"Between the lines of fear and blame, you begin to wonder why you
came"*.** The two lines are the two sides of the street as they drive,
as well as the two sides of their emotions. One side goes foreword while
the other goes back, similarly they go back and forth from fear and
blame, placing them on the fringe in-between. They fear for where the
road may lead, while blames are thrown across.\ **The car becomes the
physical as well as emotional vehicle in this whole song.**\ Physically
and emotionally, she starts to wonder why she came into this
car/relationship.



***"Let him know that you know best, because after all you do know
best"***. The song then identifies the girl as the life saver. She knows
best, she knows how to save his life.



**"Try to slip past his defense, without granting innocence".** At this
point, the girl cunningly makes her case. She puts up a front to get
past his defenses. He has a prideful heart, and the only way to get
through, is to play a game of coercion. In this game, she tries to fight
through his stubbornness. In a sense, it's like "Inception". She needs
to plant this idea within his mind, and to do so, she needs to go past
his defensive heart. She fails once he's convinced of his innocence, his
pride will force him to fight, and he'll never be convinced.



She loses the battle. Because eventually, she's captured by her own
intentions, and just lays it down too simply. It says,\ *** "Lay down a
list of what is wrong, things you told him all along. Pray to God he
hears you."** * She's done everything, all she can do now is pray.



He then responds, the same way she knew he would.\ ***"As he begins to
raise his voice, you lose yours, and grant him one last choice. Drive
until you lose the road, or break with the ones you've
followed".***\ His defense mechanism triggered, she grows silent. Not
being cunning enough, she knew the path of this road all too well.
Either he continues until regaining his cool, or she breaks up with him.
She chooses the latter.



The breakup card is played, and he is left with only two
choices. \ ***"He will do one of two things: he will admit to
everything, or he'll say he's just not the same, and you'll begin to
wonder why you came".**  *\ The first time she *"wonders why she
came"* , it was mostly describing the physical situation. However the
second sentence isn't describing the car anymore. Her emotions turn
cold, her heart becomes hardened, and retribution is impossible.\ **Once
she starts to wonder why the relationship began, it ends.** Doubt and
lack of trust became the killer.



Most of this song is difficult to interpret. It is composed from just
snippets of information. However, upon listening to the chorus,
everything comes together and it is the key to this interpretation The
whole time, the composer talks in the 3rd person as he tells a story.
However, once the chorus begins, he goes into 1st person, and describes
all these events as his own.



**The composer of this song is his own antagonist.**



I know he hasn't died, but he doesn't have to. **His life is the girl,
and he lost her.** 



***"Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend. Somewhere along the
bitterness. And I would have stayed up with you all night, had I known
how to save a life"***. The word relationship is a singular word,
because it involves two people as a singular entity. Once that entity
dissipates, the life that it has dies. 



**Thanks for reading this long rant.** Although these circumstances
aren't mine, or even yours, everyone understands. It's soo innate for
all of us growing up, trying to make things work. **After we have
discovered as children, who we are, we start to search for the other
person who can help us in who we become.** Whether we are traveling
through different stretches of road, we can all instinctively resonate
with the song.



Listen to this song, and follow the lyrics. I've placed the lyrics
below. I think by looking at it closely, you'll see how poetic and how
well placed each word is. The composer has a talent to leave the pieces
on the page, while we ourselves put the pieces together. I love the
ambiguity! Every person who reads the lyrics, listens to the song, get
their own version depending on their own experiences and realities.
Music is powerful, because of its storytelling ability as well as its
ability to connect with the listener on a level deeper than just
pictures and text.



In my own commentary, I'll say that regardless of background this whole
song is about change. A lot of times, relationships end because one or
both parties are unwilling to change and move into a new life.
**Unwillingness to sacrifice, a break of trust, an incompatibility in
beliefs; regardless, these changes or inabilities to change break the
pillars of which hold two hearts together.**\ As we deep deeper into
finding that other person in our lives, keep these ideas in mind. A
relationship, even platonic ones are a life, and sometimes it's worth
keeping, while sometimes its better to just move on.



**The Fray - How to Save a Life**



| Step one, you say, "We need to talk"
| He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
| He smiles politely back at you
| You stare politely right on through
| Some sort of window to your right
| As he goes left and you stay right
| Between the lines of fear and blame
| You begin to wonder why you came
| Where did I go wrong?
| I lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness
| And I would have stayed up with you all night
| Had I known how to save a life
| Let him know that you know best
| Because after all, you do know best
| Try to slip past his defense
| Without granting innocence
| Lay down a list of what is wrong
| Things you told him all along
| Pray to God he hears you
| And pray to God he hears you
| As he begins to raise his voice
| You lower yours and grant him one last choice
| Drive until you lose the road
| Or break with the ones you've followed
| He will do one of two things:
| He will admit to everything
| Or he'll say he's just not the same
| And you'll begin to wonder why you came
