| **To You:** who **saw** me **fall**.
| Pulling myself up, I climbed to the top to see that victory is blind.





| **To You:**\ who **found** me **ignorant**.
| Seeking enlightenment, I became learned and realized the bliss in
ignorance.Â 



| **To You:**\ who **stole** my **heart**.
| Stealing yours, I returned the act but now we both bleed.



| **
To You:** who **saw, found** and **stole** me.
| I **fall** to my own **ignorance** because my **heart** is misplaced.



| 
| *Which is why I thank you, for rescuing me anyways.*
