Good luck to everyone on exams. The best advice I can give to anyone in
scholarly endeavors is; enjoy what you're doing. If not for what you're
studying, then surround yourself with something that is enjoyable. We
tend to forget things which are discomforting. If you hate studying, you
might as well just do something else, because you'll probably force
yourself to forget lest prone to PTSD.
