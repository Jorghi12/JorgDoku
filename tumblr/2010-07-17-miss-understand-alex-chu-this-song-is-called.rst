Miss. Understand - Alex Chu



This song is called Miss. Understand, and its one of my most frequent
songs. It has a very soft mellow tone, and Alex really does a good job
accentuating the nature of the songs lyrics. The lyrics have varying
levels of complexity depending on how it is interpreted, and there are
multiple interpretations, all which converge on the same idea. The title
denotes two different meanings, talking about misunderstandings, and
asking a girl, Miss, to understand his feelings. There is an idea of
duality, two paths, two interpretations. The idea that there are reasons
that words can explain, and the possibilities of misunderstanding. did a
half hearted attempt to translate the lyrics, sorry if
they're disappointing. The korean lyrics are much more poetic and
meaningful than my bad rendition of them.



| **Stay up all night to see why, to know how
한참을 그저 서로의 눈을 바라보네**
| For a long time, we are looking into each others eyes
|   



| **말할 수 없는 이유 그댄 이미 알고 있나요**
| Reasons words can't explain, do you understand them
| **여기서 돌아가요 oh
**\ From here, lets go back



| **Miss. Understand, 오해는 잠시 떠도는 별처럼**
| Miss. Understand, For a second, let the misunderstandings become like
drifting stars
| **눈물은 꽃이 되어 피겠죠 내게도 그렇게**
| Tears turn to flowers, which bloom for me as well



|  
| **I made up my mind to say why, to know how**
| **이제는 우리 서로의 길을 걸어가네
**\ Now, it seems we're walking different paths



| **말할 수 없는 이유 그댄 정말 알 수 있나요
Reasons words can't explain, do you understand them
여기서 돌아가요 oh**
| From here, lets go back



| **Miss. Understand, 오해는 잠시 떠도는 별처럼**
| Miss. Understand, For a second, let the misunderstandings become like
drifting stars
| **눈물은 꽃이 되어 피겠죠 내게도 그렇게**
| Tears turn to flowers, which bloom for me as well
| **끝인가요 정말 끝인가요 우리의 함께했던 날들...**
| Is it the end, is it really the end, the days we can spend together
happily
|  
| **예민해진 서로를 더 이상 감당할 수 없었기에**
| Nervous because of our unmaintainable relationship
| **진실 혹은 말할 수 없는 이유, 그 벽을 넘기엔**
| The reason we weren't unable to speak the truth, and overcome our fate
| **굳게 다문 입술과 쉽게 떨어지지 않는 입술**
| Lips are tightly closed and difficult to move
| **그 사이에 새어 나온 돌이킬 수 없는 실수
**\ The irreversible mistake that seeped from our relationship
| **달콤했던 꿈을 깨뜨렸던 나**
|  The sweet dream, that became broken
| **아니, 우린 혹시 다른 꿈을 꾸었었던가**
| No, had we just been dreaming different dreams
| **지금 흘린 눈물 덕에 아무것도 몰랐으면 모두**
| Now, I'm thankful for these tears, as if we didn't know anything
| **내가 짊어질 테니 I still pray for you**
| I'll take responsibility, I still pray for you 





| **말할 수 없는 이유 그댄 정말 알 수 있나요
Reasons words can't explain, do you understand them
여기서 돌아가요 oh**
| From here, lets go back



| **Miss. Understand, 오해는 잠시 떠도는 별처럼**
| Miss. Understand, For a second, let the misunderstandings become like
drifting stars
| **눈물은 꽃이 되어 피겠죠 내게도 그렇게**
| Tears turn to flowers, which bloom for me as well
| **Miss. Understand**
| **yeah 애써 막아보려 했던 마음**
| yea, my attempt to block out the feelings
| **내 걸음이 그댈 찾아 헤매었던 밤**
| My steps to chase after you that night
| **I miss you more than that time
you know I miss you more than that time**
| **Miss. Understand**
