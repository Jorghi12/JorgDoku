`via <None>`__

Saw Clara Chung today at her loveprint tour, but this time I was the
official photographer. So I didn't have too much time aside from
photographing the event to listen, albeit Clara is a wonderful musician.
But for a minute I had to lay down my camera and listen to this song.
She dedicated it to her friend, a little ambiguously. But the lyrics
could then explain the reasoning behind her appropriation.



**So I guess I will also make my own dedication. To the Daphne that we
all know**.



**I hope you will listen.**



*Dear Daphne*



| Put him down
| That clown of a thing you call a man
| Put him down
| Put it down
| That liquid courage 
| Too much courage made you foolish now
| You'll drown
| You'll drown
| Stay with me
| Your eyes are rolling to the back of your head
| Stay with me
| Remember the things that I said
| Til then I'll be holding your head
| Your head
| I was there
| A dead soul looking for love
| In pretty snake holes
| You're now there
| You're opening bombs in gift wrap
| Without a care
| Get out of there
| Get out of there
| I see so much of me in you
| But only the pages I threw away
| From my story
| You don't need 
| That kind of black and blue
| Marking up your heart
| Bleeding through all of your pages
