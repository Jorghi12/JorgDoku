`via <None>`__

This song is about the relationships we lose. As the wheel spins, old
friends become relegated to our memories while new relationships are
formed. It is always sad to lose friends, and sometimes we lose those
whom we really cherish. However, life still follows like a wheel, no
start or end, just continual movement.



John Mayer - Wheel



| People have the right to fly
| And will when it gets compromised
| Their hearts say "Move along"
| Their minds say "Gotcha heart"
| Let's move it along
| Let's move it along
| And airports
| See it all the time
| Where someone's last goodbye
| Blends in with someone's sigh
| Cause someone's coming home
| In hand a single rose
| And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
| That's the way this wheel keeps working now
| And I won't be the last
| No I won't be the last,
| To love her
| And you can't build a house of leaves
| And live like it's an evergreen
| It's just a season thing
| It's just this thing that seasons do
| And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
| That's the way this wheel keeps working now
| And you won't be the first
| No you won't be the first
| To love me
| You can find me, if you ever want again
| I'll be around the bend
| I'll be around the bend
| I'll be around,
| I'll be around
| And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
| You just might find if you give it time
| You will wave hello again
| You just might wave hello again
| And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
| That's the way this wheel keeps working now
| You can't love too much, one part of it (repeat then fade)
| I believe that my life's gonna see
| The love I give
| Return to me
| I believe that my life's gonna see
| The love I give
| Return to me
| I believe that my life's gonna see
| The love I give
| Return to meÂ
