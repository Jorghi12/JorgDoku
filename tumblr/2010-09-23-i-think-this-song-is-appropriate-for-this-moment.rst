`via <None>`__

I think this song is appropriate for this moment in time. Definitely sad
that I didn't get to see passion pit last night, but oh well, regret
shouldn't be a word i use very often.



| Some day you'll see
| Surrounded by angels floating atop of the sea
| On bended knee
| Don't go where they go, don't sing all the songs they sing
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knew
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knew
| Between these walls
| Her back, strange glimpse, casts shadows frighteningly tall
| I slow to a crawl
| I jump and I yell but she hears nothing at all
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knew
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knew
| Stay, stay the same
| 'cause everything else will change
| And I've always been to blame
| So please just stay the same
| The currents pull me in
| The tide has reached my chin
| The seaweed tickles skin
| Just let the water win
| I'm freezing to the bone
| You'll never be at home
| Just watch, you're running out
| Just watch your body go
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knew
| Nobody knows you the way you know you
| But I think I do
| But I thought I knew, yeah, I thought I knewÂ
