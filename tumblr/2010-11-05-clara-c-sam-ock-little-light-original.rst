Clara C & Sam Ock - Little Light (Original)





It's a catchy song, but most of all, the lyrics are awesome! This is
good songwriting!



| I could lavish my life
| With a bed of silken fallacies
| But underneath are rotten springs Hey
| I’m starting to see
| Facades that we fabricate
| Slowly crumbling away



| No guarantee that I’ll be strong
| I guarantee my pride is singing this song
| I’m scared to show my little black box
| But it’s all for you



| This little light will go away if I won’t be real
| This little light will run away if I won’t tell you how I feel
| Little light please stay please stay
| Help me to tolerate myself
| Myself
| Myself
| ‘Cause I feel so vain



| I am bright as the sun
| With a crimson heat so blackening
| And at the core the cool’s shut in
| The sun knows its time to set
| and to draw a close
| My memory just won’t comply
