John Mayer is one of my favorite musicians, and a good case study for an
artist, gone star, and then collapsing under its own supernova.



His first album, “Room For Squares”, was a great success. Buzzing just
like \ **Neon **\ in social circles with a new voice and \ **City
Love**. Musically sophisticated, yet lyrically \ **Blank,**\ he left
mixed impression on **St. Patrick’s Day**. However, people loved his old
school 19\ **83 **\ haircut and honest face. His hit single “\ **Your
Body Is a Wonderland**\ ” became immortalized, although he wasn’t very
good with words or women, he didn’t mind writing **A Love Song for No
One.**\ But then again\ **There is No Such Thing** as a bad love song,
as long as it’s from the heart. And John had a good, innocent heart,
albeit may he had a **Stupid Mouth**.



His second album “Heavier Things”, left a lighter impression. But John
didn’t drop the ball or fall off the **Wheel**. With **Clarity**, he
wanted to show that he had matured from a **Home Life**\ style to a
**New Deep** philosophy. Sales weren’t as great as “Room for Squares”,
but the song "**Daughters"** hit a sweet spot in our **Only Heart.**
However, there was **Something Missing.**\ With such a quick maturation
in lyrical style, some responded in a **Split Screen Sadness**.Maybe he
really meant it when he said, “Cause I’m **Bigger Than My Body** gives
me credit for”. 



“Continuum” was released in 2006 with a much more matured philosophy. He
had strong **Belief**\ s, that even though **Gravity** would hold us
down, we could still change the world. Like a **Vulture,**\ he was
**Waiting on the World to Change**. Musically still talented, and now
lyrically sharp, **The Heart of Life** was good. The limelight grew
stronger, and the heat of stardom was like **Slow Dancing in a Burning
Room**. He couldn’t **Stop This Train** even if he wanted. **Bold as
Love** but **Dreaming with a Broken Heart,** he was a star **In
Repair.**



Released only last year, in “Battle Studies” supernova John started to
show his battle scars. Unhealed from **Heartbreak Warfare, Half His
Heart** was already lost. On the **Edge of Desire,** what resulted was a
string of questions. Tired of broken relationships, he asked,
“\ **Friends, Lovers, or Nothing?”.** Tired of losing others, he asked
“Why is it that, **All We Ever Do is Say Goodbye?”.**\ Tired from being
misunderstood, he asked, “\ **Do You Know Me?”**. Tired of judgment, he
asked “\ **Who says **\ I can’t get stoned?” John was a **Perfectly
Lonely Assassin** in the **War on Life.**



What a great musician. His transparency is a personal satire of basic
human emotion.



**For those who fall back in love, and can’t escape.**



| Oh I will 
| Leave the light on 
| I'll never give up on you 
| Leave the light on 
| For me too 



| Back to me,
| I know that it comes
| Back to me,
| Doesn't it scare you
| Your will is not as strong,
| As it used to be



**In the hope that we may remend lost friendships from time.**



| You can find me, if you ever want again
| I'll be around the bend
| I'll be around



| And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
| You just might find if you give it time
| You will wave hello again
| You just might wave hello again



**In attempts to prevent our beloved from burning out.**



| She's always buzzing just like
| Neon, neon
| Who knows how long,
| She can go before she burns away
| I can't be her angel now
| You know it's not my place to hold her down
| And it's hard for me to take a stand
| When I would take her anyway I can



From a cool burning star, to a massive supernova, we reflect our own
life in these songs. However, this is just a case study. I can’t
generalize too much, and I hope these words are taken with a grain of
salt. But maybe my reasoning in writing this article has nothing to do
with John. Maybe I’m just writing it to show, that good musicians take
hold of their audience with their lyrics. Although a good song catches
the ear, a great song can capture the mind and heart. With their lyrics,
they wish to be understood. **Maybe we should do them a justice and
listen.**
