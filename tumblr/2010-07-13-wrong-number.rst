get this call from a 503 (Portland) number, so I pick up. The
conversation went like this.

| **Caller:** Do you miss me?
| **Me:** Sorry, who is this?

but I smashed your PS3. I didn't know what came over me, I miss you soo

| **Me:** Look, I don't know who you are, i'm sitting at a bagel shop
right now in San Diego. You should call your real boyfriend right now
because I think he'll be mad that you broke his PS3.

I feel really bad for this guy. He lost his PS3, and his girlfriend is
crazy.
