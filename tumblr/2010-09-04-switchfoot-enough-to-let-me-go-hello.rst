| Switchfoot - Enough to Let Me Go
| (Hello Hurricane)Â 



| Oh, I'm a wandering soul
| I'm still walking the line that leads me home alone
| All I know I still got mountains to climb on my own
| On my own
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| To let me follow through, let me fall for you, my love
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Back from the dead of winter
| Back from the dead and all our leaves are dry
| You're so beautiful tonight
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Back from the dead we went through
| Back from the dead and both our tongues are tied
| You look beautiful tonight
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| But every seed dies before it grows
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| To let me follow through, let me fall for you, my love
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Breathe it in and let it go
| Every breath you take is not yours to own
| It's not your to hold
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
| To let me follow through, let me fall for you, my love
| Do you love me enough to let me go?
