The purpose of an open mind is the same as of an open mouth, it's meant
to close on something. An open mind in pursuit of the truth, needs to
seek it out and eventually close on it, so that we can know what is
real.



I hate people who say that they're just "open minded" to refute an
argument. So open in fact, that maybe their brain will fall out.
