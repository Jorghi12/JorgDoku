A lot of my friends like to read in order to escape reality, but my
reason is the exact opposite. I read because it helps me understand
reality.



Just finished "Super Freakonomics" by *Steven Levitt*. It's been a long
time since I've done some non-academic reading. Although I spend a lot
of my time in bookstores and libraries, it's mostly for the ambiance and
I don't actually get to pry into any of their contents.

I would definitely recommend any of *Levitt's* work, his prose is
entertaining and the content is novel and worth the read. He discusses
the economic aspects of prostitution and healthcare in terms of suicide
bombers, but my incorporation has definitely led to some personal
thought on post-college life.



The way I see it, don't let college interfere with your education.
School is only a means, and grades are only a score. Lest we pin
ourselves down against our own well being to achieve a high mark on the
transcript. Deliberately contemplate if endeavors, whether in education,
achievements, and in general life are reinforcing.
