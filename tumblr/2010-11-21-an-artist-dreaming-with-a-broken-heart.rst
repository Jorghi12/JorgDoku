John Mayer is one of my favorite musicians, and a good case study for an
artist, gone star, and then collapsing under its own supernova.



His first album, Room For Squares, was a great success. He was buzzing
just like **Neon**\ in social circles with a new voice and **City
Love**. Although his lyrics left **Blank** stares on for crowds. He
wasn't very good with words, usually just writing  \ **A Love Song For
No One. **\ Like
