I just thought I would share a funny conversation I had today with a
random scientist I met at the cafeteria.



Background: I just found out this guy just got his PhD



| **Me:** Congratulations, what made you want to pursue a PhD in
biophysics?
| **Scientist:** Because it gets me da LAYDIESS!!Â 



\*awkward silence



| **Me:** Really?
| **Scientist:** Well.... Not anymore..... Now It barely gets me a job



I didn't know how to respond to that, so I moved somewhere else.
