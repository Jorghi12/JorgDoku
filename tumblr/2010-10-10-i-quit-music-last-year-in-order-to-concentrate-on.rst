`via <None>`__

I quit music last year in order to concentrate on other aspirations.
However, I realized that without music, other aspirations ran thin. So I
pulled out my old guitar, bought a new pair of strings, and now I
remember why things used to feel soo easy. When you're doing the things
you love, your actions make sense in the large scope of things. Music
never grows old.
