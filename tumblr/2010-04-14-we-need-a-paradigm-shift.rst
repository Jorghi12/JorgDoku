It's called the heroes journey. Have you heard of it? I bet you have. I
bet you are soo familiar with the story, that you are already sick of
it. You've become very critical about the heroes journey, and although
you don't recognize it by name, everyone who lives in our generation is
acquainted with this idea. And although we believe so firmly in the
heroes journey, we live our lives in the complete opposite manner. We
definitely need a  paradigm shift.



The heroes journey is composed of five key elements.



The first element is the introduction of the hero. He is an average
person, discontent with his current life and mediocre at most. As an
audience, we have a strong urge to dislike the heroes contentment.



Then, the second element is introduced. The hero, under some magical and
interesting circumstances is introduced against his will to a new
lifestyle or world. This new world, whether magical or scary, consists
of several key things. An antagonist whom the hero needs to confront, an
obstacle which is intertwined with the heroes personality trait that he
needs to overcome, and a skill which the hero needs to develop.



The hero is uncomfortable, and frightened, but in the third element, a
guide helps him traverse and learn the rules of the new world in order
for him to become proficient in this new skill. As the audience, we
become very enthralled by the heros dedication and perseverance. We take
highly to this because it is the first development of character.



In the fourth element, the hero confronts the antagonist, and usually
loses due to a flaw in his personality. At this point, the hero loses
something important to him. The audience shares sympathy, as they see
the second development in character.



However, reflecting upon his loss, the hero takes it upon himself to
outgrow his character flaw. Quickly, the hero becomes much stronger and
in the fifth element, he overcomes the antagonist. He learns that the
only limitations are those in which he sets upon himself. The audience
is then left with a very good feeling within themselves, as if they had
traversed the heroes journey alongside the protagonist. They leave the
story, rejuvenated with motivation, but only if this was how the world
truly was. Only if everyone learned to overcome their character flaws
and proceed to follow their journeys. If only we were all entrusted the
traverse the heroes journey in our own lives.



Now do you understand what I'm talking about? To name off several titles
and hero in which most of you are acquainted with, there is



| The Matrix: Neo
| Lion King: Simba
| The Divine Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradisio): Dante
| Sun Wukong, Son Oh Gong: Monkey King
| Wanted: Wesley Gibson
| Avatar: Jake Sully
| Harry Potter Series: Harry Potter
| Fearless: Jet Li 



These are only the obvious renditions, however, almost any story will
follow this logic. As an audience, we are bombarded with repetition
after repetition of the same story. In fact, we don't even know that we
are being told the same story with different plots, characters and
circumstances to fill in the blanks.



However, the heroes journey is an illusion. Watching this illusion
satisfies our own pre-determined desires of fulfilling anything
meaningful. We are given the exact paradigm for a great story, and so we
forget that the story of our own life is not getting any development. We
become content with mediocrity and stop the development of our own
character. It is much easier to watch another person persevere through
trials and come out a better person than become that person ourselves.
So turn off the tube, and live outside the illusion. We definitely need
a paradigm shift.
