    "In the digital universe, there are two kinds of bits:
    bits that represent structures (differences in space)
    and bits that represent sequence (differences in time).
    Digital computers - as formalized by Alan Turing, and
    developed by John von Neumann - are devices that translate
    between these two species of bits according to definite rules."

    -- George Dyson: Turing's Cathedral

I've always wanted to learn to program, so I'm teaching myself.
In a way, I've started this blog as a way to keep track of my progress and to
share it with everyone else.
