    "In the digital universe, there are two kinds of bits:
    bits that represent structures (differences in space)
    and bits that represent sequence (differences in time).
    Digital computers - as formalized by Alan Turing, and
    developed by John von Neumann - are devices that translate
    between these two species of bits according to definite rules."

    -- George Dyson: Turing's Cathedral
