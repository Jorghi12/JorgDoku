So here is a slightly technical tip which will help **ALMOST ANYONE**
improve their photos. This does not **only** effect people who use
expensive camera gear, but in fact, it is more important for those using
cheaper cameras.

So here is a picture, can you tell what is wrong with it?

Maybe you don't see it yet. But what if I upload the corrected version
of this picture.

Now it makes sense. You'll probably say, the color is wrong. But more
precisely, it was a problem with white balance or color temperature.
Most DSLR's which can shoot in RAW have the advantage of being able to
adjust this setting after you've taken a picture. However, if you're
like the many who have a point-and-shoot camera which directly links to
JPEG, you'll have to learn how to fix this in camera before you take a
picture. A lot of times understanding white balance makes a big
difference.

So what is white balance, and how do I fix these on my camera? Just read
a little longer and I'll show you.

White balance is exactly what is sounds like. It is a standard of
balancing color, which balances white (or grey)  to produced correctly
color balanced pictures. Incorrect white balance tends to shift to the
red or the blue of the RGB color spectrum leaving you with unflattering
shifted images. I'm baffled at how often, "professional" photographers
who charge for their photos mess up white balance so often. It
is embarrassing, and people will use the "creativity" moniker to justify
their incorrect WB.

**DON'T BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE!**

**I will seriously own you.**

First you'll have to find the white balance option on your camera. It'll
look something like this.

There will be multiple options. These are usually the standard drawings
to denote specific white balances. These pictures will make knowing the
white balances SOO MUCH EASIER to understand. White Balance is measured
in Kelvin, which is the temperature of the incident light. But Instead
of memorizing each temperature for each different type of light, you can
just use the pictures.

For normal sunlight situations, the sunlight mode on the far left is
best. For cloudy days, the cloud. And depending on the type of
lightbulb, whether it's incandescent or fluorescent, you'll use one of
the two blinking light's in the center. While using flash, you'll use
flash, and the custom white balance is kind of advanced for this type of
tutorial. A lot of newer cameras do a pretty decent job of setting WB
automatically. But your eyes are soo much better than the camera, and
setting this manually will ensure you get it right the first time.
