**Only after disaster, do we reconstruct our opinions and values.**


| It is only after you have sacrificed something, that you realize its
| value.
| It is only after you've lost everything, do you realized that you
| owned anything.
| It is only after you've come to despair, that you wish to have
| comfort.

The last tumblr post, I wrote about something similar. AboutÂ Narcissism,
those who have beauty, not understanding its meaning. This time, I take
the other vantage point, and talk about the solution.

**Things fall apart. Do we give up?**

You [STRIKEOUT:should not] will not give up on things that matter.
