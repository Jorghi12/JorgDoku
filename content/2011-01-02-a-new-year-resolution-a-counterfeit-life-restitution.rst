Unusual from the daily grind, I woke up early to see the 2011 on my
phones home screen. In my mind, I wrote down a simple list of things I
wanted to do this year.\ ** It's been a day since the end of New Years
celebrations, and although my phone tells me different, not much has
changed.**

| Body: Push it
| Spirit: Break it
| Friends: Cherish them
| Family: Love them
| Grades: Own them

Don't make a resolution for change, keep the solution that you've always
known. **Theres no substitution in life's institution. **

Happy New Years everyone!
