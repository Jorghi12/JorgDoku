**Wushu Concept Photoshoot #2 - Melvin Hseih (Low Key)**

So here is the second part of the photoshoot, finally finished
processing and uploading. We shot this on the top floor of the Gilman
parking structure right as the sun was going down for two main reasons.
#1, so that we wouldn't get caught Â playing with swords around too many
people, and #2 so that we could get some high key shots with some
ambient lighting and low key shots with a 3 point flash setup. The low
key shots were definitely harder to take and edit, mostly due to
balancing the 3 flashes appropriately. But in the end, I think we ended
up with some great material. Thanks a lot to Melvin Hsieh for modeling
for me, and Filbert Banh for assisting with lighting.
