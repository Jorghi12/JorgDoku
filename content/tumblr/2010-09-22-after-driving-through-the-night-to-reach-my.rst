**On the Road: Going to Texas**

After driving through the night to reach my destination, I started to
see the peak of sunlight come from the horizon. I immediately stopped my
car and took out my camera.

Sometimes the most inspiring light will only show itself right after
pitch darkness. Never stop driving, never stop pursuing your dreams!
