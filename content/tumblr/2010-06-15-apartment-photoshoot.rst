It's been a while since I've done some *chika chika* with my camera.
It was really nice to get back into photography after a hectic week of
final exams. Here is a sample of a photoshoot for Isabel and
herÂ apartment mates. They were the cutest 4 girls ever, and its always
fun to take pictures when everyone else is enjoying the experience!
