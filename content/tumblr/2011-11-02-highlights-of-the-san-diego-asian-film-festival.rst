**2011: San Diego Asian Film Festival (SDAFF)**

I got the great opportunity to shoot as a press photographer for
`Taipei543`_, a culture blog and magazine started by UCSD alumni.
It was such a great experience, got to hang out with
some famous maybe even infamous stars and got some coverage on some
exclusive events. Never thought that photography would be able to take
me to so many new places and help me meet new people.
