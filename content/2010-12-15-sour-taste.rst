**How does a good friendship go sour?**

Just like how anything goes sour, when it's snatched from the vine,
taken out of the fridge, kept past the expiration date.

   </p>

We all lose friends, and the sour taste left residually in our mouths
only hurts because we know how good it used to be.

   </p>

**Before it expired.**

But personally, I think I'm just going to go buy a new carton of milk.
Good till the last drop.
