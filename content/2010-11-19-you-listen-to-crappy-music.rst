I have a problem with Far East Movement.

The 50th Anniversary of UCSD, we invite them to preform for us. They're
popular, huge fan base of Asian-American as well every other ethnicity.
They proclaim to be making a revolution, a movement for Asian-Americans
in American pop culture.\ **But without a doubt, I do not see style or
songwriting which distinguishes them from every other popular artist in
the industry. Of course, other than their ethnicity.**

Correlation does not equal causation. Statistics will show that smarter
people usually own more books, but thats not to say owning books makes
people smart. So please, do not say, "I am an Asian-American, and I am
also a hit musician, ergo I am changing the social norm". Your logic is
wrong. **Being a hit artist while carrying an ethnic stamp does not
change the industry.**

FM is a group of singers, songwriters and performers. But in these 3
categories, where do they excel? **Can they sing like Bono? Can they
compose like Yo-Yo Ma? Can they perform like Michael Jackson or Ben
Folds?!**

These are all industry changing musicians and songwriters. Their
excellence, distinguishes them from other musicians. **The art they
create changes perception rather than acclaims to ones which already
have foundations.**\ With virtue of their talent and nature, they rose
to change the way music is perceived by the masses.

But this is the problem. Talent isn't necessary to hit charts. "Like a
G6", hit charts at No.1 in 3 countries, while their new single
"Rocketeer", just hit charts recently. We listen to poetic garbage.

Here is an excerpt from "Rocketeer"

**Baby we can stay fly like a G6,
Shop the streets of Tokyo get your fly kicks,
Girl you always on my mind,
Got my head up in the sky,
And I'm never looking down feelin' priceless, yeah,
Where we at, only few have known
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, Cardio,
Til' then let's fly, Geronimo.**

Sensibly, it has no taste. **Lyrically, its free form written slang with
poor grammar.** Poetically, the strings of lines are strung together to
make sure the last 3 lines rhyme. The first line is a reference to an
older song. Still, a G6 is a bad reference to a G5, which is the actual
plane. But I guess adding 1 to the plane number makes it better. The 5th
line is a reference to the master card commercials.

But then again, it's not FM who is the problem. It is us. Why do we
resort to listening to this music. I bet most people didn't even know a
G6 wasn't a real plane, or even heard the badly placed mastercard
product placement. Does anyone know who Geronimo was, without doing a
quick wikipedia search. What we put in, is what we put out. I don't
think "I like listening to catchy music" makes sense. When we don't
consciously think about our music, we end up with mediocrity in the
industry.\ **We demand "catchy", and so catchy is the new industry
standard.**

I think I might be harsh when I make these claims. But being a smart
consumer, of music, of products and of life is important. **Music is
powerful.** Classes are being taught in universities about The Beetles
and social revolution. But that doesn't mean we can relegate those times
to the history books. Because music continues to be a powerful medium of
education, information and social norms. **We
can't disillusion ourselves to think FM will do our job and change the
industry for us.** We change the industry ourselves, by seeing talent,
by making conscious decisions to empower our own beliefs.

Don't be a hipster and stop yourself from listening to mainstream music.
But don't just follow the crowd either.

**Make your own decision.** Listen to music, which makes sense.
