I dunno about anyone else, but I laughed pretty hard in public.


The point of the joke is that all mathematical manipulation before you
multiply the waveform with the complex conjugate is imaginary. It's only
real after the fact. I guess most people won't really understand unless
you've worked with wavefunctions and imaginary numbers.
