Around the end of 2011, I stopped blogging. I had created
a photography website using wordpress and was trying to
make a living as any recent graduate would. I chose photography
because I was good at it, and I had experience shooting with
some `professional photographers <http://nathanielkamphotography.com>`_
in the san diego area.

    However, I didn't go to school in photography, I had studied chemistry.

But upon realizing the difficulties associated with work in science
with only an undergrad education, I chose photography. I was ultimately to
study medicine, and it was my 2nd attempt at that crazy application cycle.

New Job New World
------------------

I got a job in Santa Barbara in engineering the next generation of
photonic switches. It was a real job, the technology was a relic lost during the
dotcom bubble, where many tech companies perished and crashed from the burst.
But now at resurgence of cloud computing and the demand of on the backbone
of the fiber-optic infrastructure some companies were starting to hire again.
It was something I believed in, information travling at the
speed of light through optical fiber, and was satisfying that itch
for uncovering new and novel ways of doing things, so I took the job and
didn't look back.

    Since then, I've learned a lot. So I've decided to start blogging again.

LightQuanta

I've decided to name this blog :code:`LightQuanta.`

   The equation :math:`E_{photon} = h\nu - \varphi` describes the particle nature of light quantized

   But I'm excited to start blogging again, and I hope you follow along!
