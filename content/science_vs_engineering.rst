Recently a friend contacted me about looking over a bit of Chemistry.
It was one of nasty `retrosynthetic analysis`_ problems for designing
organic synthesis.
Three years or so this kind of thing would have been much more
common, but since then, the only practical use for
Chemistry has been explaining the science of Breaking Bad to friends.

But was is no harm in trying, and I had some free time, so I decided to give
it a shot. Surprisingly, somehow I'm not completely incapable,
the tricky part interestingly ended up being a `Diels-Alder Cycloaddition`_.

    Molecular Orbitals with the same sign must overlap during the cycloaddition.
