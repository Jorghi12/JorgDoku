Here are some of my tools.

:Camera:
  Fuji X100s

There was a time when I used to be quite a gearhead. A list of all my
previous photography gear would include, a Canon 5D Classic,
an amazing affordable full-frame camera body. Some lenses include
the Canon EF 35mm f/2.0 and the nifty-fifty Canon EF 50mm f/1.8II.
A couple years ago, I've decided to put all this gear behind, and haven't
really looked back since. The Fuji does a magnificent job albeit
having an APS-C sized sensor, there is something I do miss about full-frame
that I'll just have to live with.

I do all my photography and programming on my Macbook Pro.
I've customized it with more RAM and added a solid state disk replacing the
optical tray. OS X is a surprisingly good enviornment for programming
since it was built upon a variant of BSD and is fully POSIX compliant.
