Hi I'm Sang Han
---------------------

Welcome LightQuanta!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sanghan.me is a consolidation but incomplete representation of things
I can articulate and translate into hypertext. In the long term, I hope
to turn this into a useful website filled with insightful information
that will be able to bring a fully grown man to tears.

That website has not been written. Hopefully one day with a lot of thinking
before I fully realize what I'm doing that project will come to fruition.

.. pull-quote::

    "In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.
    In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing,
    you should not be doing it. Of course, you seldom, if ever,
    see either pure state."

Richard Hamming: *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering*
