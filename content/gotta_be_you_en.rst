.. pull-quote::

    I'm the one that needs to apologize...
    I want to make things better


.. line-block::

   I don’t wanna meet new people
   I don’t know why I still hate you
   Our encounter was like destiny
   But now we’ve turned from lovers to strangers.
   You left me but your scent still lingers.
   We used to be all turnt up.
   We’ve grown farther apart, more and more.
   You said no but you just wait for the love battle.
   Again today,
   I shout out Let’s go back
   Rewind to the past
   To the beginning XO

   I hate seeing myself still not over you
   I try to forget but I can’t, every day
   It’s gotta be you
   It can’t be over

   It ain’t over til it’s over
   It ain’t over til it’s over
   It ain’t over til it’s over

   Even if your love ruins me and hurts me
   To me, it’s only you
   My love starts with you and ends with you
   I’m waiting for you right here

   It’s gotta be you, no
   My one and only oh oh oh
   It’s gotta be you, no
   It’s gotta be you by my side

   Trap me again in your prison
   The reality without you is so cruel
   Though it’ll be so hard, I don’t care
   Because I’m a fox, I have nine lives
   Even if I’m broken down hundreds of times by your fierce waves
   I’m okay, though it hurts, when I’m in front of love, I’m desperado
   No matter what anyone says
   I don’t care at all
   Because the song we used to dance to is not over yet
   I’m shouting out to you right now
   Let’s go back
   Rewind to the past
   To the beginning XO

   I hated you for coldly saying this is the end
   I try to erase you but I keep drawing you out
   It’s gotta be you It can’t be over

   It ain’t over til it’s over
   It ain’t over til it’s over
   It ain’t over til it’s over

   Even if your love ruins me and hurts me
   To me, it’s only you
   My love starts with you and ends with you
   I’m waiting for you right here

   It’s gotta be you, no
   My one and only oh oh oh
   It’s gotta be you, no
   It’s gotta be you by my side

   I close my eyes but I think of you
   Each and every one of your faces

   You are my first and last love, don’t say goodbye

   Even if your love ruins me and hurts me
   To me, it’s only you
   My love starts with you and ends with you
   I’m waiting for you right here

   It’s gotta be you, no
   My one and only oh oh oh
   It’s gotta be you, no
   It’s gotta be you by my side
