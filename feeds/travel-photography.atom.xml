&lt;p&gt;So I spent a lot of time this summer reading up on different photography
techniques. One in particular which I have always wanted to be good at
was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt;. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; is hard, and I&amp;#8217;ve never been able to produce an image
that I felt was good enough to show to anyone&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who don&amp;#8217;t know what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; is, it stands for High Dynamic Range.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; takes multiple pictures with different exposures (brightnesses), so
that it can capture all the dark and light areas of an image and merges
them into a single image which carries all the information of the scene.
This bypasses a limitation of digital cameras, because unlike our eyes
which can adjust to capture light at different levels of exposure, a
digital camera can only open and close the shutter once to capture the
full depth of an image. However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; can be difficult because processing
an image can end up looking unrealistic and blending exposures comes
with its own&amp;nbsp;hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a lot of failed attempts, I finally came upon a good
opportunity to shoot an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt;, and I gave it my best try.&amp;nbsp;I was at
Gasworks Park near the University of Washington campus, and my friend
was commenting about how I should take a picture of the skies. When I
saw what she was pointing at, I realized that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to
shoot it with one exposure, so I strapped the camera around my wrist and
made an attempt to shoot a handheld &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
