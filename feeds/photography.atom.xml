Before photography, I was a chemist.
I worked at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNF&lt;/span&gt; Novartis doing medicinal chemistry.
Those days were full of many great memories and I enjoyed my time there doing
chemistry. These days I am still in good contact with the people I met,
and worked with. Soon after I had left, word had spread to Yefen,
and she had become interested in getting a family portrait with her very young
1 year old daughter Amber. Of course, I was happy to oblige
and Yifen and I started to contact each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days with the advent of cheap digital &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; cameras,
it has become difficult to find the best photograph. Amber is Yifen&amp;#8217;s daughter,
and she is one of the cutest and happiest babies
I have had the chance to capture in still.
However photographing children is a completely different story.
Sometimes they&amp;#8217;re unresponsive and unintuitive to the camera facing them.
Sometimes they just want to play, and are difficult to approach strangers.
I was up to the challenge, and utilizing in conjunction my very broken
Mandarin Chinese and babytalk,
I wanted to capture the happy relationship between the family and their&amp;nbsp;child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnathan &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Chelsea are both good friends of mine.
I actually knew both of them individually, before and after they became an item.
Johnathan and I have worked together through several student organizations
and were both officers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt; Photography club.
Johnathan however, specializes in videography,
and that is where our differences will probably lie.
Chelsea and I met through many close friends,
and I can reminisce of many great times while we were still&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photoshoot in particular was a meaningful one.
It was one of the ways I could say thanks to all the great times that we
all had shared as friends, and also, in wishing the best of opportunities
as we all finished the last years of college and pursue our own separate paths.
It&amp;#8217;s a nostalgic and bittersweet feeling to see friends move on,
together and on their own dreams and ambitions. As a photographer,
I can share my goodbyes and goodwills with at least a picture
and maybe less than a thousand&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
