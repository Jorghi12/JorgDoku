The most well known and famous most likely being,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://octopress.org"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, both of these are pretty similar blogging enginese. Jekyll is
used by Github Pages as the default site generator, while Octopress is
a framework geared specifically for blogging. However, the reason why
I decided to use Pelican over both of these options doing the job
fantastically well, is because Pelican is written in Python, and therefore
support the reStructuredText markup by default. I&amp;#8217;ve looked into Jekyll and
Octopress, as well as many other similar generators, and not many support
anything other as&amp;nbsp;Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my primary forcuses of blogging is so that I can also use it as
a platform for learning more about programming. I don&amp;#8217;t program in ruby
so, I wanted to go with an all Python&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-pelican"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter&amp;nbsp;Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Pelican became my blogging engine of choice.
There are a couple other generators written on top of
Python like &lt;cite&gt;Hyde &amp;lt;http://ringce.com/hyde&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
and &lt;cite&gt;Nicola &amp;lt;http://getnikola.com&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;, but it seemed like Pelican was
better supported and documented of the batch, so thats what I went&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
