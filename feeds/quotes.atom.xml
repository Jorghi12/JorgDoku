&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the digital universe, there are two kinds of bits:
bits that represent structures (differences in space)
and bits that represent sequence (differences in time).
Digital computers - as formalized by Alan Turing, and
developed by John von Neumann - are devices that translate
between these two species of bits according to definite&amp;nbsp;rules.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I finished reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/1400075998"&gt;Turing&amp;#8217;s Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, my interests were focused towards science and engineering,
but never had I crossed paths with programming and computer science.
Even in my academic life as an undergraduate studying chemistry
or in my professional life in engineering. The world of bound by code
was much of a mystery, and after reading this book, I decided on taking the
next step and try to understand programming and see where it would lead&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a wonderful&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
