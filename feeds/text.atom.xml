improve their photos. This does not &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; effect people who use
expensive camera gear, but in fact, it is more important for those using
cheaper cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is a picture, can you tell what is wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2489110/20101028%20-%20_MG_7908.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you don't see it yet. But what if I upload the corrected version
of this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2489110/20101028%20-%20_MG_7908_corrected.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it makes sense. You'll probably say, the color is wrong. But more
precisely, it was a problem with white balance or color temperature.
Most DSLR's which can shoot in RAW have the advantage of being able to
adjust this setting after you've taken a picture. However, if you're
like the many who have a point-and-shoot camera which directly links to
JPEG, you'll have to learn how to fix this in camera before you take a
picture. A lot of times understanding white balance makes a big
difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is white balance, and how do I fix these on my camera? Just read
a little longer and I'll show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White balance is exactly what is sounds like. It is a standard of
balancing color, which balances white (or grey) &amp;nbsp;to produced correctly
color balanced pictures. Incorrect white balance tends to shift to the
red or the blue of the RGB color spectrum leaving you with unflattering
shifted images. I'm baffled at how often, &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; photographers
who charge for their photos mess up white balance so often. It
is&amp;nbsp;embarrassing, and people will use the &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot; moniker to justify
their incorrect WB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will seriously own you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First you'll have to find the white balance option on your camera. It'll
look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://sharpcatalog.com/camera/img/cameraSetup/screenWhiteBalance-L.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be multiple options. These are usually the standard drawings
to denote specific white balances. These pictures will make knowing the
white balances SOO MUCH EASIER to understand. White Balance is measured
in Kelvin, which is the temperature of the incident light. But Instead
of memorizing each temperature for each different type of light, you can
just use the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For normal sunlight situations, the sunlight mode on the far left is
best. For cloudy days, the cloud. And depending on the type of
lightbulb, whether it's incandescent or fluorescent, you'll use one of
the two blinking light's in the center. While using flash, you'll use
flash, and the custom white balance is kind of advanced for this type of
tutorial. A lot of newer cameras do a pretty decent job of setting WB
automatically. But your eyes are soo much better than the camera, and
setting this manually will ensure you get it right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

photography. One question in particular that I get almost every time is
about which cameras, lenses and other equipment they should purchase.
And a lot of times, I really don't feel like I can substantiate this
with an answer without first asking multiple questions myself. Like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you take pictures of? People? Are you the person among your
group of friends who is always documenting the moment? Does everyone
expect you to be the one uploading and tagging shots on facebook??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landscapes? Are you always bringing your camera when going on that next
adventure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art? Is normal photography too mainstream? Are you trying to express
some creative impulse? Do you hang around coffee shops with large framed
glasses and an ipad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of times photography is less about the equipment you own, and more
about the subject that you wish to put on the SD card (please don't
troll me about this). And in fact, you don't need to spend ridiculous
amounts of money to have the right camera. Most of the time, the best
camera is the one you own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in order to give an answer to this small rant. I think the question
here is worded incorrectly. Most of the time, people ask about camera
equipment, not because they want to buy something, but because they have
a desire to take better pictures. In this case, I would recommend buying
a &lt;strong&gt;FILM CAMERA!&lt;/strong&gt;Sounds crazy, but it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with point-and-shoot cameras is in the name. The purpose is
to be able to point at a scene and just take a shot. Automation destroys
the desire to learn and makes photography less rewarding. So throwing
yourself into manual settings really opens up a new world for people. If
you can take a decent picture with a film camera, you will probably take
AMAZING ones in digital. Also, film bodies and lenses are dirt cheap.
You can pick them up from craigslist for &amp;lt;$100 and these used to be top
of the line professional equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you a step in that direction, I would&amp;nbsp;recommend the Canon AE-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/fd/images/ae-1-program/D3S_7456-1200.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these on craigslist and ebay for $50 with a 50mm f/1.8 FD
fixed focal length lens. The fixed focal length means that the lens
doesn't zoom. But this is more of an advantage. It causes you to think
more about composition and the quality of pictures are outstanding. You
can also purchase a variety of other FD lenses, zoom and fixed for dirt
cheap. You just have to remember one thing, make sure to buy film!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this little rant. It's a lot of fun for me to talk to
others about photography. If anyone has any questions at all that they
would like me to answer, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

But we
first have to understand that creating the image which puts absolution
to the moment is somewhat of an arduous task. And in fact, most photos
fail to come close to meet this somewhat abstract criterion for a
&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although understanding this, most people will never admit to a bad
photo. They come up with cleaver reasonings to vindicate a shot and thus
first place a primal block on their chance of learning from their
mistakes. Working with some of these people, I've heard some pretty good
excuses, most using the &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot; moniker as a mental force field
against constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we really need to understand is that taking a bad photo is indeed a
good thing. Taking the underexposed 35 degree tilted, center focused
slightly blurry photo with major white balance problems is where most
people start. Eventually, we learn to focus, compose and the desire to
correct ourselves pushes us to the better image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, from the back&amp;nbsp;of a thousand poorly taken photographs spurs an
image redemptive of each past failing exchange. But most of the time, we
just end up taking the shot and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

photography, the more I realize my inexperience. Not only in the
technicalities, but in simple creativity and vision, the bread and

school, the soft spoken one with the timid stature nobody really paid
much attention to.&lt;/strong&gt; He was polite and usually not very talkative. Until
his encounter with an addictive substance. His life would never be the
same, and this anecdote is repeated carrying with it, the adage against
drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The negative stigma against addictive substances carries moral, social
and even political bearing. Cigarettes give you cancer, as well as a
hole in your throat. But the campaign against substance abuse is deeper
than most of us can even comprehend.&lt;strong&gt;It's easy to place the cursed
mark against a chemical, a plant or the occasional smoker, but how about
the one you love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathology of substance abuse is a well researched department of
neurophysiology. We love studying the pleasure complex. The basis
of&amp;nbsp;pavlovian&amp;nbsp;conditioning is established on our knowledge of rewards
and&amp;nbsp;penalties. &lt;strong&gt;Drug abuse theory highjacks the natural mechanisms of
pleasure, and places an inanimate chemical or cigarette in its
place.&lt;/strong&gt;But lets step back a bit outside the box and flirt with the
idea, maybe the natural rewards have the same physiological and
addictive properties as any other substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it's a far fetched idea to consider this contention. We've
heard Ke$ha sing &amp;quot;Your love, your love, your love, is my drug&amp;quot;, and
we've seen the poor individuals struck with love sickness like a rehab
patient undergoing&amp;nbsp;withdrawal. But aside from the symbolic juxtaposition
of words and literary devices, can we really think of love in medical
terms? Or, to go a step further, of other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;*Medical Definition*&lt;/strong&gt;of addiction is based on several stages.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolerance:&lt;/strong&gt; After a period of continual exposure, each exposure&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;

Line block ends without a blank line.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;becomes less meaningful than the first.
| &lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon&amp;nbsp;separation&amp;nbsp;for an extended period of time, the
user starts to feel physical as well
as&amp;nbsp;psychological&amp;nbsp;withdrawal&amp;nbsp;symptoms.
| &lt;strong&gt;Priority:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The user places priority of the substance high enough,
that albeit negative societal and health factors, still continues to
pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, It's not just substance or behavioral addiction i'm talking
about, It's people addiction. Who are the addicts, who are the drugs?
&lt;strong&gt;In the brain, it's all the same chemistry, but now we've substituted
our close friends and loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; No longer are we able to take a
clear moral stance on the issue. I would argue, that many people face
this&amp;nbsp;dilemma, and&amp;nbsp;unbeknown&amp;nbsp;to them the implications of their own
addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are addicted. The key is transcendence over the situation
and cutting the ailment from the source. It's not healthy to depend on
others for gratification and emotional well being. &lt;strong&gt;It's easy to tell,
because you can feel the momentum of the emotional roller coaster
ride;&amp;nbsp;day by day, latching from heart flutter to another significant
other.&lt;/strong&gt; Cutting the habit can only occur from deep introspection away
from these distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting perspective to take. I've recently been taking a lot
of courses related to addiction and pathology. Along with the
interactions I've been observing these past couple quarters, this
subject has become a recurring theme. Maybe this means I should pursue
something in neuroscience or psychiatry in the future. But only time can
tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one last remark. Unlike actual addiction pathology, there is a
problem with people addiction unlike most problems. And that is, both
the addict, and the drug are victims. The drug, although a person, is
not treated as such. &lt;strong&gt;Epitomized and sought out for, objectification is
a shallow existence.&lt;/strong&gt; I would even say, the plight of the drug is a
much more&amp;nbsp;grievous of a&amp;nbsp;circumstance. Because the problem of the addict
is internal, while the problem of the drug is external. The only
solution, is for someone else to be the remedy. But who would be willing
to do that, for aid to a drug is to become addicted yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading the description of the game, they start to take the test as
follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many players are allowed to play the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What determines who gets the first turn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What shape is the board compiled of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, Jenny doesn't have a reading problem. But in fact, &lt;strong&gt;she's a dumb
genius&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what Candice saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;



 .. raw:: html

    &lt;/p&gt;

 The game can be played by two, three or four players, with
 additional rules provided for solo and four-player partnership play.
 Each player has a rack of six randomly-chosen tiles which are
 concealed from the other players. The board is also made up of a
 number of hexagons, with the two outermost rings reserved for three-
 and four-player games respectively. The rules state that the
 youngest player takes the first turn, although where multiple games
 are played it is common practice for the first turn to rotate
 clockwise around the board in subsequent games.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking the exam, both girls are quite intelligent and score 100%.
&lt;a href="#id1"&gt;&lt;span class="problematic" id="id2"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;However&amp;nbsp;Candice spends the whole weekend on the test, while Jenny goes
out to the movies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#id3"&gt;&lt;span class="problematic" id="id4"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Interestingly, Jenny performs as well as Candice
despite her dyslexic&amp;nbsp;inattention&amp;nbsp;to detail.&lt;/p&gt;

Inline strong start-string without end-string.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I don't think any of you had a problem answering the problems with
Jenny's version, despite taking only fraction of the time reading
it.&amp;nbsp;The key is quickly overlooking the clutter, and choosing the
important details. &lt;strong&gt;Although this is just a silly variant of a game, it
becomes deep once the rules no longer depict a board game, and becomes
replaced with our own lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us choose to read the whole article for the sake of accuracy and
precision. &lt;strong&gt;However, our desires for completeness undermines the
ambition set for our performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Albeit Candice's weekends effort,
her mind is overloaded with&amp;nbsp;unnecessary&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now lets place the dice at a higher level. Not only for board games, but
difficult college courses, reading e-mails, complex literature and
interpersonal relationships.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It's not recklessness, it's not
inattention or disregard of detail. It's what we call a genius.&lt;/strong&gt;While
we all search for the needle in a haystack, it is the reckless who
search the whole haystack. The genius knows where to search first.&amp;nbsp;Great
speakers know the right words, great musicians know the right notes and
great students don't read the whole textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe it's time that we all become more like Genius Jenny rather than
Candid Candice.&lt;/strong&gt; What we have been taught about working hard should be
replaced with a mantra of working smart. Because Jenny got to go to the
movies, and she's probably happier that way.&lt;/p&gt;

taken out of the fridge, kept past the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;

It's been itching my mind for some time now, because to be frank, the
story doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know The Story of Narcissus. In a brief summary, Narcissus
is a greek myth about the effect of beauty, and love for oneself.
Narcissus was a son of a nymph, born very&amp;nbsp;handsome, every girl fell in
love with him at first sight. Hardened by their love, he believed no one
worthy of his affection. One day, while walking in a forest, Narcissus
was followed by a mountain nymph named Echo. Upon hearing Echo's
pursuit, Narcissus yelled out &amp;quot;Who's There?&amp;quot;. Unable to speak first,
Echo replied &amp;quot;Who's There?&amp;quot; In time, Echo showed herself, professing her
undying love. However, heart still hardened, Narcissus would not accept
Echo's love and shattered her affection to pieces. In response, Nemesis,
the god of hubris and vengeful fate, put a curse on Narcissus. That once
Narcissus looked upon a pond, he fell in love with his own reflection.
Unable to leave the pond, Narcissus&amp;nbsp;withered&amp;nbsp;away and died, and where
his body left, grew the Narcissus flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;Narcissism&amp;quot; now refers to people who love themselves more than
others, and the the story became an immortal symbol for
self-propagated&amp;nbsp;adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I don't agree with this idea. &lt;strong&gt;My problem with this story, is
that the main theme isn't self-adoration, but is the destructive
properties of beauty.&lt;/strong&gt; Dying of self-adoration is a fitting punishment,
yet, it isn't the main point. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissus is a symbol of raw beauty in the world. &amp;nbsp;He is appealing to
the eye, and attains shallow raw admiration from all who he meets.
However, pride has captured his heart and that has numbed his senses
from being able to differentiate between shallow and deep affection.
Even in the sight of Echo, he is unable to distinguish between what is
true love. In greek, the word Narcissus is derived from Narke, which
means to sleep, or to be numb. &lt;strong&gt;The problem of those who have been
blessed with the gift of beauty, is their numbness to it.&lt;/strong&gt; The storys
ending treads a ominous path. It is only fitting that, unable to
understand the value of beauty, he fall victim to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the&amp;nbsp;dilemma&amp;nbsp;of unrequited narcissism. For those who have
fallen beyond the scope of beauty and aestheticism, they are yet just an
Echo, a clanging sound in the mist of an orchestra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From what I gain from this story, is a realization that we chase
dearly for beauty, yet not knowing how much it causes us to wither
away.&lt;/strong&gt; For those who play the role of Narcissus, humility is the key.
For those who play the role of Echo, it maybe time to re-evaluate and
move on. But for most of us, who resonate with both these characters, it
is important to realize these perspectives, and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty if beauty's own reward, however fulfilling it is dependent on
ones own decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of greek mythology, is that although it is
thousands of years old, we are still affected by these themes everyday.
Classic literature is soo inspiring, hopefully I'll get to read more as
time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50th Anniversary of UCSD, we invite them to preform for us. They're
popular, huge&amp;nbsp;fan base&amp;nbsp;of Asian-American as well every other ethnicity.
They proclaim to be making a revolution, a movement for Asian-Americans
in American pop culture.&lt;strong&gt;But without a doubt, I do not see style or
songwriting which distinguishes them from every other popular artist in
the industry. Of course, other than their ethnicity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlation does not equal causation. Statistics will show that smarter
people usually own more books, but thats not to say owning books makes
people smart. So please, do not say, &amp;quot;I am an Asian-American, and I am
also a hit musician, ergo I am changing the social norm&amp;quot;. Your logic is
wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Being a hit artist while carrying an ethnic stamp does not
change the industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FM is a group of singers, songwriters and performers. But in these 3
categories, where do they excel? &lt;strong&gt;Can they sing like Bono? Can they
compose like Yo-Yo Ma? Can they perform like Michael Jackson or Ben
Folds?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all industry changing musicians and songwriters. Their
excellence, distinguishes them from other musicians. &lt;strong&gt;The art they
create changes perception rather than acclaims to ones which already
have foundations.&lt;/strong&gt;With virtue of their talent and nature, they rose
to change the way music is perceived by the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is the problem. Talent isn't necessary to hit charts. &amp;quot;Like a
G6&amp;quot;, hit charts at No.1 in 3 countries, while their new single
&amp;quot;Rocketeer&amp;quot;, just hit charts recently. We listen to poetic garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an&amp;nbsp;excerpt&amp;nbsp;from &amp;quot;Rocketeer&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby we can stay fly like a G6,
Shop the streets of Tokyo get your fly kicks,
Girl you always on my mind,
Got my head up in the sky,
And I'm never looking down feelin' priceless, yeah,
Where we at, only few have known
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, Cardio,
Til' then let's fly, Geronimo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensibly, it has no taste. &lt;strong&gt;Lyrically, its free form written slang with
poor grammar.&lt;/strong&gt; Poetically, the strings of lines are strung together to
make sure the last 3 lines rhyme. The first line is a reference to an
older song. Still, a G6 is a bad reference to a G5, which is the actual
plane. But I guess adding 1 to the plane number makes it better. The 5th
line is a reference to the&amp;nbsp;master card&amp;nbsp;commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then again, it's not FM who is the problem. It is us. Why do we
resort to listening to this music. I bet most people didn't even know a
G6 wasn't a real plane, or even heard the badly placed mastercard
product placement. Does anyone know who Geronimo was, without doing a
quick wikipedia search. What we put in, is what we put out. I don't
think &amp;quot;I like listening to catchy music&amp;quot; makes sense. When we don't
consciously think about our music, we end up with mediocrity in the
industry.&lt;strong&gt;We demand &amp;quot;catchy&amp;quot;, and so catchy is the new industry
standard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I might be harsh when I make these claims. But being a smart
consumer, of music, of products and of life is important. &lt;strong&gt;Music is
powerful.&lt;/strong&gt; Classes are being taught in universities about The Beetles
and social revolution. But that doesn't mean we can relegate those times
to the history books. Because music continues to be a powerful medium of
education, information and social norms. &lt;strong&gt;We
can't&amp;nbsp;disillusion&amp;nbsp;ourselves to think FM will do our job and change the
industry for us.&lt;/strong&gt; We change the industry ourselves, by seeing talent,
by making conscious decisions to empower our own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't be a hipster and stop yourself from listening to mainstream music.
But don't just follow the crowd either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your own decision.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to music, which makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was walking towards the Starbucks on Costa Verde Plaza this early
afternoon, looking to fix myself on an early bout of a hot caffeinated
beverage. But while I was passing the bookstore, I saw a bald headed man
sitting down on his cell phone. After hearing his voice, I clearly
recognized the man, he was a medicinal chemist at Takeda
Pharmaceuticals, the place I had interned exactly one year ago. So I
looked over to him, and once he saw me, he politely finished his phone
conversation and headed in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His name was John, and we were really close during my drug design
internship I feel like he was more of a mentor figure rather than a job
associates. We both shared similar enthusiasm for the sciences, and
would chat across the bench while prepping columns and setting up
reactions. Our conversations progressed through every avenue and subject
matter, from the inner workings of a pharmaceutical company to the
difference between Asian and American culture (lots of Japanese
scientists work at Takeda). However, in order to pursue my ambitions of
being a doctor, I decided not to continue working after my internship
period had expired. It was a bittersweet goodbye, but one in which I
needed to take. I didn't want to be a scientist, I wanted to be a
doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing him again, we reminisced of old times and filled each other on
life. Tomorrow, John would fly to Japan, to work at Takeda in Osaka. He
would be there for a year, and this being my last year at UCSD, the
chances of another random encounter would be slim. We chatted it up like
old times, and the conversation moved back and forth with ease. However,
at a moment in time, something interesting struck my mind. We were two
people, one following pursuits in medicinal chemistry, and another,
branching off into practical medicine, two different people, two
different paths, two different times, but yet having the same
conversation. The words were different, and the subject matter had
shifted, but on a macroscopic level, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it may seem unclear what I am trying to say, but please be patient
and let me expound upon this topic a little bit more. Afterwards, we had
to part ways, and I got my overpriced stock of coffee and moved into the
bookstore for some quick reading. While browsing through badly cataloged
magazine files, I&amp;nbsp;saw the back of a magazine entitled &amp;quot;HBR&amp;quot;. The first
thing that flashed in my mind was Bromic Acid, and I would be extremely
wrong to think so, it was &amp;quot;Harvard Business Review&amp;quot;. But I had already
picked up the book, so I sat down and gave it a half hearted read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was never interested in business. In fact, I had some pre-conceived
notions about people who were more business oriented, and in fact, a lot
of these biases were expressed while reading through the magazine.
However, I came upon an article which made me think again. The article
was entitled &amp;quot;Management is Not a Profession&amp;quot;, and in it, the author
discusses the&amp;nbsp;propensity&amp;nbsp;of people to internalize their career not as a
commodity, but as their personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I realized from this article, is regardless of what people
specialize in, whether it is Business, Law, Medicine, Science etc.. From
reading a business article, I came to realize the extent to which we
compartmentalize. The propensity of generalize ourselves, others and
everything else in the world in order to understand it. However, it is
politically correct to make statements like &amp;quot;be yourself&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;love you
for who you are&amp;quot;. Statements which offer an individual his/her own right
to be defined as himself and not the clothes on his skin or title near
his name. However, no matter how hard we try not to generalize, we
become enslaved by our own inability to understand without
simplification through demarcation.&amp;nbsp;I am not a scientist, a doctor, but
I am a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

studies is reading for pure enjoyment. It was only during college when I
sacrificed pleasure reading in order to make room for my studies. But
ironically, my engagement in sacrifice only led to the detriment of my
intellectual pursuits rather than expanding them. So upon coming home, I
made a quick trip to the book store and&amp;nbsp;caroused&amp;nbsp;through the shelves and
picked up something interesting. Reading through little snippets of
literature made me realized how much I was missing out, and how bland
the dialogue inside my brain had become. The book I picked out was
&amp;quot;Salt&amp;quot; by Mark Kurlansky, and I recall my high school humanities teacher
once discussing it at the&amp;nbsp;beginning&amp;nbsp;of my senior year. So I picked it
up, and while reading the end of the introduction, I came upon this
passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But while a love story is timeless, the story of a quest for wealth,
given enough time, will always seem like the vain pursuit of a mirage&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon reading that, I quickly made up my mind that this was going to be
the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now to preface the conclusion that I am going to reach, there are things
in this world that we want because we don't have them, and there are
things that we inherently desire forever. Salt, oil, money, fame,
friends, we search for primarily because we don't have, or feel as if we
are inadequate to procure the amount of our desires. Now whether our
desires are limited or unlimited is&amp;nbsp;impertinent, but something like love
is of the later category. We desire the affections of others, not
because we lack them, but because it is inherent in our nature to search
for it. In order to exemplify this, I'll start out with an example of
salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the word salt comes to mind, many people think of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://www.icis.com/blogs/icis-chemicals-confidential/Morton%20Salt%20Girl.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is simple table salt, and I think
it's quite the ignorance of modern culture to replace something as
important and historic as salt with a girl in a yellow dress. This
reminds me of a french folktale which relates the story of a princess
who declares to her father, &amp;quot;I love you like salt,&amp;quot; and the father,
angered by the slight, banishes her from the kingdom. Only later when he
is denied salt does he realize its value and therefore the depth of his
daughters love. Salt is so common, so easy to obtain, and so inexpensive
that we have forgotten that from the beginning of civilization until
about 100 years ago, salt was one of the most sought-after commodities
in human history. So as of now, the thousands of years of culture and
bloodshed made in the preservation of salt, the wars fought on its
behalf, and peoples&amp;nbsp;diligence in obtaining it, we cannot&amp;nbsp;commiserate&amp;nbsp;on
their behalf because salt is a commodity wherein its value is calculated
from its abundance. So now, we are only left with the girl in a yellow
dress and a remnant of a salty taste in our mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, oil, money and fame, have a similar destinations as
salt. The wars we have fought in procuring oil, and the money that goes
into filling our gas tanks will be thought of as petty quarrels when oil
has been replaced with an alternative fuel and monetary inflation causes
our dollars to become worthless. In fact, it is because we wish to value
these commodities, that the commodities have any value. None of these
things have actual inherent value, which is why the paradigm to procure
them have no inherent meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is the whole point of this long late night ramble. What I've
come to realize is that many people who know exactly what they want to
do with their lives are following the wrong paradigm. They proceed to
seek out the commodities in which we have placed relative meaning while
they forget to seek out the things which have absolute meaning. Things
like love, happiness, and especially God are placed secondary and are
most of the times sacrificed. I quote James, in a passage where he
addresses the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that
city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.'&amp;nbsp;Why, you do
not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a
mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-James 4:13-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think once we have addressed what we are truly looking for in life, we
end up with very simple answers about seemingly complex problems. The
story of a life is something more ethereal and important than a search
for money and status. Rather, a story of love, a search for meaning and
purpose sounds about right. Personally, I just think I have to read
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnite!&lt;/p&gt;

woke up, and it was today. But unlike expectations, I wasn't sad that it
was just a dream and not reality. In fact, I was happy. I was happy to
know that I had lived for a time, and I still have much to live for.
These memories make each day much more meaningful, and the memories to
come make each day worth looking&amp;nbsp;foreword&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;

Hart and Marie Digby were all awesome. I really love Clara's voice and
she's super nice in person to. I think a lot of people came to see Marie
Digby, and she was really down to earth and quirky. At the end of the
concert, she played an encore of Rhianna's umbrella and we got to go up
and sing and dance with her. Sam Hart was really chill and played a lot
of emo songs.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you heard of it? I bet you have. I
bet you are soo familiar with the story, that you are already sick of
it. You've become very critical about the heroes journey, and although
you don't recognize it by name, everyone who lives in our generation is
acquainted with this idea. And although we believe so firmly in the
heroes journey, we live our lives in the complete opposite manner. We
definitely need a &amp;nbsp;paradigm shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heroes journey is composed of five key elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first element is the introduction of the hero. He is an average
person, discontent with his current life and mediocre at most. As an
audience, we have a strong urge to dislike the heroes contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the second element is introduced. The hero, under some magical and
interesting circumstances is introduced against his will to a new
lifestyle or world. This new world, whether magical or scary, consists
of several key things. An antagonist whom the hero needs to confront, an
obstacle which is intertwined with the heroes personality trait that he
needs to overcome, and a skill which the hero needs to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hero is uncomfortable, and frightened, but in the third element, a
guide helps him traverse and learn the rules of the new world in order
for him to become proficient in this new skill. As the audience, we
become very enthralled by the heros dedication and&amp;nbsp;perseverance. We take
highly to this because it is the first development of character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth element, the hero confronts the antagonist, and usually
loses due to a flaw in his personality. At this point, the hero loses
something important to him. The audience shares sympathy, as they see
the second development in character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, reflecting upon his loss, the hero takes it upon himself to
outgrow his character flaw. Quickly, the hero becomes much stronger and
in the fifth element, he overcomes the antagonist. He learns that the
only limitations are those in which he sets upon himself. The audience
is then left with a very good feeling within themselves, as if they had
traversed the heroes journey alongside the protagonist. They leave the
story,&amp;nbsp;rejuvenated&amp;nbsp;with motivation, but only if this was how the world
truly was. Only if everyone learned to overcome their character flaws
and proceed to follow their journeys. If only we were all&amp;nbsp;entrusted&amp;nbsp;the
traverse the heroes journey in our own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now do you understand what I'm talking about? To name off several titles
and hero in which most of you are acquainted with, there is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Matrix: Neo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Lion King: Simba&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Divine Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradisio): Dante&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sun Wukong, Son Oh Gong: Monkey King&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wanted: Wesley Gibson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Avatar: Jake Sully&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Harry Potter Series: Harry Potter&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Fearless: Jet Li&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are only the obvious renditions, however, almost any story will
follow this logic. As an audience, we are bombarded with repetition
after repetition of the same story. In fact, we don't even know that we
are being told the same story with different plots, characters and
circumstances to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the heroes journey is an illusion. Watching this illusion
satisfies our own pre-determined desires of fulfilling&amp;nbsp;anything
meaningful. We are given the exact paradigm for a great story, and so we
forget that the story of our own life is not getting any development. We
become content with mediocrity and stop the development of our own
character. It is much easier to watch another person&amp;nbsp;persevere&amp;nbsp;through
trials and come out a better person than become that person ourselves.
So turn off the tube, and live outside the illusion. We definitely need
a paradigm shift.&lt;/p&gt;
