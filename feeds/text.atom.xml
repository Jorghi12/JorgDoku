improve their photos. This does not &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; effect people who use
expensive camera gear, but in fact, it is more important for those using
cheaper cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is a picture, can you tell what is wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="/img/20101028_MG_7908.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you don’t see it yet. But what if I upload the corrected version
of this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="/img/20101028_MG_7908_corrected.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it makes sense. You’ll probably say, the color is wrong. But more
precisely, it was a problem with white balance or color temperature.
Most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt;’s which can shoot in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; have the advantage of being able to
adjust this setting after you’ve taken a picture. However, if you’re
like the many who have a point-and-shoot camera which directly links to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt;, you’ll have to learn how to fix this in camera before you take a
picture. A lot of times understanding white balance makes a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is white balance, and how do I fix these on my camera? Just read
a little longer and I’ll show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White balance is exactly what is sounds like. It is a standard of
balancing color, which balances white (or grey)  to produced correctly
color balanced pictures. Incorrect white balance tends to shift to the
red or the blue of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RGB&lt;/span&gt; color spectrum leaving you with unflattering
shifted images. I’m baffled at how often, "professional" photographers
who charge for their photos mess up white balance so often. It
is embarrassing, and people will use the "creativity" moniker to justify
their incorrect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;’T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THESE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will seriously own you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you’ll have to find the white balance option on your camera. It’ll
look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="/img/screenWhiteBalance-L.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be multiple options. These are usually the standard drawings
to denote specific white balances. These pictures will make knowing the
white balances &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUCH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EASIER&lt;/span&gt; to understand. White Balance is measured
in Kelvin, which is the temperature of the incident light. But Instead
of memorizing each temperature for each different type of light, you can
just use the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For normal sunlight situations, the sunlight mode on the far left is
best. For cloudy days, the cloud. And depending on the type of
lightbulb, whether it’s incandescent or fluorescent, you’ll use one of
the two blinking light’s in the center. While using flash, you’ll use
flash, and the custom white balance is kind of advanced for this type of
tutorial. A lot of newer cameras do a pretty decent job of setting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WB&lt;/span&gt;
automatically. But your eyes are soo much better than the camera, and
setting this manually will ensure you get it right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

photography. One question in particular that I get almost every time is
about which cameras, lenses and other equipment they should purchase.
And a lot of times, I really don’t feel like I can substantiate this
with an answer without first asking multiple questions myself. Like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you take pictures of? People? Are you the person among your
group of friends who is always documenting the moment? Does everyone
expect you to be the one uploading and tagging shots on facebook??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landscapes? Are you always bringing your camera when going on that next adventure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art? Is normal photography too mainstream? Are you trying to express
some creative impulse? Do you hang around coffee shops with large framed
glasses and an ipad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of times photography is less about the equipment you own, and more
about the subject that you wish to put on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card (please don’t
troll me about this). And in fact, you don’t need to spend ridiculous
amounts of money to have the right camera. Most of the time, the best
camera is the one you own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to give an answer to this small rant. I think the question
here is worded incorrectly. Most of the time, people ask about camera
equipment, not because they want to buy something, but because they have
a desire to take better pictures. In this case, I would recommend buying
a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FILM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAMERA&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;Sounds crazy, but it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with point-and-shoot cameras is in the name. The purpose is
to be able to point at a scene and just take a shot. Automation destroys
the desire to learn and makes photography less rewarding. So throwing
yourself into manual settings really opens up a new world for people. If
you can take a decent picture with a film camera, you will probably take
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMAZING&lt;/span&gt; ones in digital. Also, film bodies and lenses are dirt cheap.
You can pick them up from craigslist for &amp;lt;$100 and these used to be top
of the line professional equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a step in that direction, I would recommend the Canon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AE&lt;/span&gt;-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="/img/D3S_7456-1200.jpg" style="width: 1200px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find these on craigslist and ebay for $50 with a 50mm f/1.8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FD&lt;/span&gt;
fixed focal length lens. The fixed focal length means that the lens
doesn’t zoom. But this is more of an advantage. It causes you to think
more about composition and the quality of pictures are outstanding. You
can also purchase a variety of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FD&lt;/span&gt; lenses, zoom and fixed for dirt
cheap. You just have to remember one thing, make sure to buy film!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this little rant. It’s a lot of fun for me to talk to
others about photography. If anyone has any questions at all that they
would like me to answer, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

But we
first have to understand that creating the image which puts absolution
to the moment is somewhat of an arduous task. And in fact, most photos
fail to come close to meet this somewhat abstract criterion for a
&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt; Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although understanding this, most people will never admit to a bad
photo. They come up with cleaver reasonings to vindicate a shot and thus
first place a primal block on their chance of learning from their
mistakes. Working with some of these people, I’ve heard some pretty good
excuses, most using the "creativity" moniker as a mental force field
against constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really need to understand is that taking a bad photo is indeed a
good thing. Taking the underexposed 35 degree tilted, center focused
slightly blurry photo with major white balance problems is where most
people start. Eventually, we learn to focus, compose and the desire to
correct ourselves pushes us to the better image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, from the back of a thousand poorly taken photographs spurs an
image redemptive of each past failing exchange. But most of the time, we
just end up taking the shot and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

school, the soft spoken one with the timid stature nobody really paid
much attention to.&lt;/strong&gt; He was polite and usually not very talkative. Until
his encounter with an addictive substance. His life would never be the
same, and this anecdote is repeated carrying with it, the adage against
drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative stigma against addictive substances carries moral, social
and even political bearing. Cigarettes give you cancer, as well as a
hole in your throat. But the campaign against substance abuse is deeper
than most of us can even comprehend.&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to place the cursed
mark against a chemical, a plant or the occasional smoker, but how about
the one you love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathology of substance abuse is a well researched department of
neurophysiology. We love studying the pleasure complex. The basis
of pavlovian conditioning is established on our knowledge of rewards
and penalties. &lt;strong&gt;Drug abuse theory highjacks the natural mechanisms of
pleasure, and places an inanimate chemical or cigarette in its
place.&lt;/strong&gt; But lets step back a bit outside the box and flirt with the
idea, maybe the natural rewards have the same physiological and
addictive properties as any other substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s a far fetched idea to consider this contention. We’ve
heard Ke$ha sing "Your love, your love, your love, is my drug", and
we’ve seen the poor individuals struck with love sickness like a rehab
patient undergoing withdrawal. But aside from the symbolic juxtaposition
of words and literary devices, can we really think of love in medical
terms? Or, to go a step further, of other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Medical Definition&lt;/strong&gt; of addiction is based on several stages.
&lt;strong&gt;Tolerance:&lt;/strong&gt; After a period of continual exposure, each exposure
becomes less meaningful than the first.
&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon separation for an extended period of time, the
user starts to feel physical as well
as psychological withdrawal symptoms.
&lt;strong&gt;Priority:&lt;/strong&gt; The user places priority of the substance high enough,
that albeit negative societal and health factors, still continues to
pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, It’s not just substance or behavioral addiction i’m talking
about, It’s people addiction. Who are the addicts, who are the drugs?
**In the brain, it’s all the same chemistry, but now we’ve substituted
our close friends and loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; No longer are we able to take a
clear moral stance on the issue. I would argue, that many people face
this dilemma, and unbeknown to them the implications of their own addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are addicted. The key is transcendence over the situation
and cutting the ailment from the source. It’s not healthy to depend on
others for gratification and emotional well being. &lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to tell,
because you can feel the momentum of the emotional roller coaster
ride; day by day, latching from heart flutter to another significant
other.&lt;/strong&gt; Cutting the habit can only occur from deep introspection away
from these distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting perspective to take. I’ve recently been taking a lot
of courses related to addiction and pathology. Along with the
interactions I’ve been observing these past couple quarters, this
subject has become a recurring theme. Maybe this means I should pursue
something in neuroscience or psychiatry in the future. But only time can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one last remark. Unlike actual addiction pathology, there is a
problem with people addiction unlike most problems. And that is, both
the addict, and the drug are victims. The drug, although a person, is
not treated as such. &lt;strong&gt;Epitomized and sought out for, objectification is
a shallow existence.&lt;/strong&gt; I would even say, the plight of the drug is a
much more grievous of a circumstance. Because the problem of the addict
is internal, while the problem of the drug is external. The only
solution, is for someone else to be the remedy. But who would be willing
to do that, for aid to a drug is to become addicted yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

multiply the waveform with the complex conjugate is imaginary. It’s only

to play a game I’ve chosen for them. I’ve given them some guidelines to
read as well as a test of their understanding. &lt;strong&gt;They both read over the
paragraph below, but strangely, this is what Jenny see’s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Xxx game xxx xx played xx two, three xx four players, xxx additional&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;rules xxxx xxx solo and four-player partnership xxxx. Each player&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxx x rack xx six randomly-chosen tiles xxxxx xxx concealed xxxx xxx&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;other players. Xxx board xx xxxx made xx xx x xxxxx xx hexagons,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxxx xxx two outermost rings xxxxxx for three xxx four-player games&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;. Xxx rules xxxxx xxxx xxx youngest player takes xxx first&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;turn, although xxxxx multiple games xxx played xx xx common practice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxx xxx first turn xx rotate clockwise around xxx board xx&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;subsequent xxxxx.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the description of the game, they start to take the test as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many players are allowed to play the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What determines who gets the first turn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What shape is the board compiled of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Jenny doesn’t have a reading problem. But in fact, &lt;strong&gt;she’s a dumb
genius&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what Candice saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The game can be played by two, three or four players, with
additional rules provided for solo and four-player partnership play.
Each player has a rack of six randomly-chosen tiles which are
concealed from the other players. The board is also made up of a
number of hexagons, with the two outermost rings reserved for three-
and four-player games respectively. The rules state that the
youngest player takes the first turn, although where multiple games
are played it is common practice for the first turn to rotate
clockwise around the board in subsequent games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the exam, both girls are quite intelligent and score 100%.
However Candice spends the whole weekend on the test, while Jenny goes
out to the movies. Interestingly, Jenny performs as well as Candice
despite her dyslexic inattention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think any of you had a problem answering the problems with
Jenny’s version, despite taking only fraction of the time reading
it. The key is quickly overlooking the clutter, and choosing the
important details. &lt;strong&gt;Although this is just a silly variant of a game, it
becomes deep once the rules no longer depict a board game, and becomes
replaced with our own lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us choose to read the whole article for the sake of accuracy and
precision. &lt;strong&gt;However, our desires for completeness undermines the
ambition set for our performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Albeit Candice’s weekends effort,
her mind is overloaded with unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets place the dice at a higher level. Not only for board games, but
difficult college courses, reading e-mails, complex literature and
interpersonal relationships.&lt;strong&gt; It’s not recklessness, it’s not
inattention or disregard of detail. It’s what we call a genius.&lt;/strong&gt;While
we all search for the needle in a haystack, it is the reckless who
search the whole haystack. The genius knows where to search first. Great
speakers know the right words, great musicians know the right notes and
great students don’t read the whole textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe it’s time that we all become more like Genius Jenny rather than
Candid Candice.&lt;/strong&gt; What we have been taught about working hard should be
replaced with a mantra of working smart. Because Jenny got to go to the
movies, and she’s probably happier that way.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been itching my mind for some time now, because to be frank, the
story doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know The Story of Narcissus. In a brief summary, Narcissus
is a greek myth about the effect of beauty, and love for oneself.
Narcissus was a son of a nymph, born very handsome, every girl fell in
love with him at first sight. Hardened by their love, he believed no one
worthy of his affection. One day, while walking in a forest, Narcissus
was followed by a mountain nymph named Echo. Upon hearing Echo’s
pursuit, Narcissus yelled out "Who’s There?". Unable to speak first,
Echo replied "Who’s There?" In time, Echo showed herself, professing her
undying love. However, heart still hardened, Narcissus would not accept
Echo’s love and shattered her affection to pieces. In response, Nemesis,
the god of hubris and vengeful fate, put a curse on Narcissus. That once
Narcissus looked upon a pond, he fell in love with his own reflection.
Unable to leave the pond, Narcissus withered away and died, and where
his body left, grew the Narcissus flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "Narcissism" now refers to people who love themselves more than
others, and the the story became an immortal symbol for self-propagated adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t agree with this idea. &lt;strong&gt;My problem with this story, is
that the main theme isn’t self-adoration, but is the destructive
properties of beauty.&lt;/strong&gt; Dying of self-adoration is a fitting punishment,
yet, it isn’t the main point. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narcissus is a symbol of raw beauty in the world.  He is appealing to
the eye, and attains shallow raw admiration from all who he meets.
However, pride has captured his heart and that has numbed his senses
from being able to differentiate between shallow and deep affection.
Even in the sight of Echo, he is unable to distinguish between what is
true love. In greek, the word Narcissus is derived from Narke, which
means to sleep, or to be numb. &lt;strong&gt;The problem of those who have been
blessed with the gift of beauty, is their numbness to it.&lt;/strong&gt; The storys
ending treads a ominous path. It is only fitting that, unable to
understand the value of beauty, he fall victim to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the dilemma of unrequited narcissism. For those who have
fallen beyond the scope of beauty and aestheticism, they are yet just an
Echo, a clanging sound in the mist of an orchestra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From what I gain from this story, is a realization that we chase
dearly for beauty, yet not knowing how much it causes us to wither
away.&lt;/strong&gt; For those who play the role of Narcissus, humility is the key.
For those who play the role of Echo, it maybe time to re-evaluate and
move on. But for most of us, who resonate with both these characters, it
is important to realize these perspectives, and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty if beauty’s own reward, however fulfilling it is dependent on
ones own decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of greek mythology, is that although it is
thousands of years old, we are still affected by these themes everyday.
Classic literature is soo inspiring, hopefully I’ll get to read more as
time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50th Anniversary of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;, we invite them to preform for us. They’re
popular, huge fan base of Asian-American as well every other ethnicity.
They proclaim to be making a revolution, a movement for Asian-Americans
in American pop culture.&lt;strong&gt;But without a doubt, I do not see style or
songwriting which distinguishes them from every other popular artist in
the industry. Of course, other than their ethnicity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation does not equal causation. Statistics will show that smarter
people usually own more books, but thats not to say owning books makes
people smart. So please, do not say, "I am an Asian-American, and I am
also a hit musician, ergo I am changing the social norm". Your logic is
wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Being a hit artist while carrying an ethnic stamp does not
change the industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; is a group of singers, songwriters and performers. But in these 3
categories, where do they excel? &lt;strong&gt;Can they sing like Bono? Can they
compose like Yo-Yo Ma? Can they perform like Michael Jackson or Ben Folds?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all industry changing musicians and songwriters. Their
excellence, distinguishes them from other musicians. &lt;strong&gt;The art they
create changes perception rather than acclaims to ones which already
have foundations.&lt;/strong&gt;With virtue of their talent and nature, they rose
to change the way music is perceived by the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the problem. Talent isn’t necessary to hit charts. "Like a
G6", hit charts at No.1 in 3 countries, while their new single
"Rocketeer", just hit charts recently. We listen to poetic garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from "Rocketeer"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby we can stay fly like a G6,
Shop the streets of Tokyo get your fly kicks,
Girl you always on my mind,
Got my head up in the sky,
And I’m never looking down feelin’ priceless, yeah,
Where we at, only few have known
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, Cardio,
Til’ then let’s fly, Geronimo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensibly, it has no taste. &lt;strong&gt;Lyrically, its free form written slang with
poor grammar.&lt;/strong&gt; Poetically, the strings of lines are strung together to
make sure the last 3 lines rhyme. The first line is a reference to an
older song. Still, a G6 is a bad reference to a G5, which is the actual
plane. But I guess adding 1 to the plane number makes it better. The 5th
line is a reference to the master card commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, it’s not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; who is the problem. It is us. Why do we
resort to listening to this music. I bet most people didn’t even know a
G6 wasn’t a real plane, or even heard the badly placed mastercard
product placement. Does anyone know who Geronimo was, without doing a
quick wikipedia search. What we put in, is what we put out. I don’t
think "I like listening to catchy music" makes sense. When we don’t
consciously think about our music, we end up with mediocrity in the
industry.&lt;strong&gt;We demand "catchy", and so catchy is the new industry standard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might be harsh when I make these claims. But being a smart
consumer, of music, of products and of life is important. &lt;strong&gt;Music is
powerful.&lt;/strong&gt; Classes are being taught in universities about The Beetles
and social revolution. But that doesn’t mean we can relegate those times
to the history books. Because music continues to be a powerful medium of
education, information and social norms. &lt;strong&gt;We
can’t disillusion ourselves to think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; will do our job and change the
industry for us.&lt;/strong&gt; We change the industry ourselves, by seeing talent,
by making conscious decisions to empower our own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a hipster and stop yourself from listening to mainstream music.
But don’t just follow the crowd either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your own decision.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to music, which makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking towards the Starbucks on Costa Verde Plaza this early
afternoon, looking to fix myself on an early bout of a hot caffeinated
beverage. But while I was passing the bookstore, I saw a bald headed man
sitting down on his cell phone. After hearing his voice, I clearly
recognized the man, he was a medicinal chemist at Takeda
Pharmaceuticals, the place I had interned exactly one year ago. So I
looked over to him, and once he saw me, he politely finished his phone
conversation and headed in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name was John, and we were really close during my drug design
internship I feel like he was more of a mentor figure rather than a job
associates. We both shared similar enthusiasm for the sciences, and
would chat across the bench while prepping columns and setting up
reactions. Our conversations progressed through every avenue and subject
matter, from the inner workings of a pharmaceutical company to the
difference between Asian and American culture (lots of Japanese
scientists work at Takeda). However, in order to pursue my ambitions of
being a doctor, I decided not to continue working after my internship
period had expired. It was a bittersweet goodbye, but one in which I
needed to take. I didn’t want to be a scientist, I wanted to be a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him again, we reminisced of old times and filled each other on
life. Tomorrow, John would fly to Japan, to work at Takeda in Osaka. He
would be there for a year, and this being my last year at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;, the
chances of another random encounter would be slim. We chatted it up like
old times, and the conversation moved back and forth with ease. However,
at a moment in time, something interesting struck my mind. We were two
people, one following pursuits in medicinal chemistry, and another,
branching off into practical medicine, two different people, two
different paths, two different times, but yet having the same
conversation. The words were different, and the subject matter had
shifted, but on a macroscopic level, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it may seem unclear what I am trying to say, but please be patient
and let me expound upon this topic a little bit more. Afterwards, we had
to part ways, and I got my overpriced stock of coffee and moved into the
bookstore for some quick reading. While browsing through badly cataloged
magazine files, I saw the back of a magazine entitled "&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HBR&lt;/span&gt;". The first
thing that flashed in my mind was Bromic Acid, and I would be extremely
wrong to think so, it was "Harvard Business Review". But I had already
picked up the book, so I sat down and gave it a half hearted read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never interested in business. In fact, I had some pre-conceived
notions about people who were more business oriented, and in fact, a lot
of these biases were expressed while reading through the magazine.
However, I came upon an article which made me think again. The article
was entitled "Management is Not a Profession", and in it, the author
discusses the propensity of people to internalize their career not as a
commodity, but as their personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized from this article, is regardless of what people
specialize in, whether it is Business, Law, Medicine, Science etc.. From
reading a business article, I came to realize the extent to which we
compartmentalize. The propensity of generalize ourselves, others and
everything else in the world in order to understand it. However, it is
politically correct to make statements like "be yourself" and "love you
for who you are". Statements which offer an individual his/her own right
to be defined as himself and not the clothes on his skin or title near
his name. However, no matter how hard we try not to generalize, we
become enslaved by our own inability to understand without
simplification through demarcation. I am not a scientist, a doctor, but
I am a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

with our last conversation, as if we were still there at that time. It
stirred up old feelings which I had left ridden in the dust of my past
years. I embraced the nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like any other dream. You wake up, and thats what happened. I
woke up, and it was today. But unlike expectations, I wasn’t sad that it
was just a dream and not reality. In fact, I was happy. I was happy to
know that I had lived for a time, and I still have much to live for.
These memories make each day much more meaningful, and the memories to
come make each day worth looking foreword to.&lt;/p&gt;
