school, the soft spoken one with the timid stature nobody really paid
much attention to.&lt;/strong&gt; He was polite and usually not very talkative. Until
his encounter with an addictive substance. His life would never be the
same, and this anecdote is repeated carrying with it, the adage against
drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative stigma against addictive substances carries moral, social
and even political bearing. Cigarettes give you cancer, as well as a
hole in your throat. But the campaign against substance abuse is deeper
than most of us can even comprehend.&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to place the cursed
mark against a chemical, a plant or the occasional smoker, but how about
the one you love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathology of substance abuse is a well researched department of
neurophysiology. We love studying the pleasure complex. The basis
of pavlovian conditioning is established on our knowledge of rewards
and penalties. &lt;strong&gt;Drug abuse theory highjacks the natural mechanisms of
pleasure, and places an inanimate chemical or cigarette in its
place.&lt;/strong&gt; But lets step back a bit outside the box and flirt with the
idea, maybe the natural rewards have the same physiological and
addictive properties as any other substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s a far fetched idea to consider this contention. We’ve
heard Ke$ha sing "Your love, your love, your love, is my drug", and
we’ve seen the poor individuals struck with love sickness like a rehab
patient undergoing withdrawal. But aside from the symbolic juxtaposition
of words and literary devices, can we really think of love in medical
terms? Or, to go a step further, of other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Medical Definition&lt;/strong&gt; of addiction is based on several stages.
&lt;strong&gt;Tolerance:&lt;/strong&gt; After a period of continual exposure, each exposure
becomes less meaningful than the first.
&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon separation for an extended period of time, the
user starts to feel physical as well
as psychological withdrawal symptoms.
&lt;strong&gt;Priority:&lt;/strong&gt; The user places priority of the substance high enough,
that albeit negative societal and health factors, still continues to
pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, It’s not just substance or behavioral addiction i’m talking
about, It’s people addiction. Who are the addicts, who are the drugs?
**In the brain, it’s all the same chemistry, but now we’ve substituted
our close friends and loved ones.&lt;/strong&gt; No longer are we able to take a
clear moral stance on the issue. I would argue, that many people face
this dilemma, and unbeknown to them the implications of their own addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are addicted. The key is transcendence over the situation
and cutting the ailment from the source. It’s not healthy to depend on
others for gratification and emotional well being. &lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to tell,
because you can feel the momentum of the emotional roller coaster
ride; day by day, latching from heart flutter to another significant
other.&lt;/strong&gt; Cutting the habit can only occur from deep introspection away
from these distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting perspective to take. I’ve recently been taking a lot
of courses related to addiction and pathology. Along with the
interactions I’ve been observing these past couple quarters, this
subject has become a recurring theme. Maybe this means I should pursue
something in neuroscience or psychiatry in the future. But only time can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one last remark. Unlike actual addiction pathology, there is a
problem with people addiction unlike most problems. And that is, both
the addict, and the drug are victims. The drug, although a person, is
not treated as such. &lt;strong&gt;Epitomized and sought out for, objectification is
a shallow existence.&lt;/strong&gt; I would even say, the plight of the drug is a
much more grievous of a circumstance. Because the problem of the addict
is internal, while the problem of the drug is external. The only
solution, is for someone else to be the remedy. But who would be willing
to do that, for aid to a drug is to become addicted yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Complex Conjugate</title><link href="http://sanghan.me/blog/2011/01/2011-01-20-complex-conjugate/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-01-20T16:14:00-08:00</updated><author><name>jjangsangy</name></author><id>tag:sanghan.me,2011-01-20:blog/2011/01/2011-01-20-complex-conjugate/</id><summary type="html">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="/img/complex_conjugate.png" style="width: 560px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno about anyone else, but I laughed pretty hard in public.&lt;/p&gt;

multiply the waveform with the complex conjugate is imaginary. It’s only
real after the fact. I guess most people won’t really understand unless
you’ve worked with wavefunctions and imaginary numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

to play a game I’ve chosen for them. I’ve given them some guidelines to
read as well as a test of their understanding. &lt;strong&gt;They both read over the
paragraph below, but strangely, this is what Jenny see’s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Xxx game xxx xx played xx two, three xx four players, xxx additional&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;rules xxxx xxx solo and four-player partnership xxxx. Each player&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxx x rack xx six randomly-chosen tiles xxxxx xxx concealed xxxx xxx&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;other players. Xxx board xx xxxx made xx xx x xxxxx xx hexagons,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxxx xxx two outermost rings xxxxxx for three xxx four-player games&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;. Xxx rules xxxxx xxxx xxx youngest player takes xxx first&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;turn, although xxxxx multiple games xxx played xx xx common practice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;xxx xxx first turn xx rotate clockwise around xxx board xx&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;subsequent xxxxx.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the description of the game, they start to take the test as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many players are allowed to play the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What determines who gets the first turn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What shape is the board compiled of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Jenny doesn’t have a reading problem. But in fact, &lt;strong&gt;she’s a dumb
genius&lt;/strong&gt;. This is what Candice saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The game can be played by two, three or four players, with
additional rules provided for solo and four-player partnership play.
Each player has a rack of six randomly-chosen tiles which are
concealed from the other players. The board is also made up of a
number of hexagons, with the two outermost rings reserved for three-
and four-player games respectively. The rules state that the
youngest player takes the first turn, although where multiple games
are played it is common practice for the first turn to rotate
clockwise around the board in subsequent games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking the exam, both girls are quite intelligent and score 100%.
However Candice spends the whole weekend on the test, while Jenny goes
out to the movies. Interestingly, Jenny performs as well as Candice
despite her dyslexic inattention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think any of you had a problem answering the problems with
Jenny’s version, despite taking only fraction of the time reading
it. The key is quickly overlooking the clutter, and choosing the
important details. &lt;strong&gt;Although this is just a silly variant of a game, it
becomes deep once the rules no longer depict a board game, and becomes
replaced with our own lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us choose to read the whole article for the sake of accuracy and
precision. &lt;strong&gt;However, our desires for completeness undermines the
ambition set for our performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Albeit Candice’s weekends effort,
her mind is overloaded with unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets place the dice at a higher level. Not only for board games, but
difficult college courses, reading e-mails, complex literature and
interpersonal relationships.&lt;strong&gt; It’s not recklessness, it’s not
inattention or disregard of detail. It’s what we call a genius.&lt;/strong&gt;While
we all search for the needle in a haystack, it is the reckless who
search the whole haystack. The genius knows where to search first. Great
speakers know the right words, great musicians know the right notes and
great students don’t read the whole textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe it’s time that we all become more like Genius Jenny rather than
Candid Candice.&lt;/strong&gt; What we have been taught about working hard should be

phones home screen. In my mind, I wrote down a simple list of things I
wanted to do this year.&lt;strong&gt; It’s been a day since the end of New Years
celebrations, and although my phone tells me different, not much has changed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Body: Push it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Spirit: Break it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Friends: Cherish them&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Family: Love them&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Grades: Own them&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t make a resolution for change, keep the solution that you’ve always
known. &lt;strong&gt;Theres no substitution in life’s institution. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been itching my mind for some time now, because to be frank, the
story doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know The Story of Narcissus. In a brief summary, Narcissus
is a greek myth about the effect of beauty, and love for oneself.
Narcissus was a son of a nymph, born very handsome, every girl fell in
love with him at first sight. Hardened by their love, he believed no one
worthy of his affection. One day, while walking in a forest, Narcissus
was followed by a mountain nymph named Echo. Upon hearing Echo’s
pursuit, Narcissus yelled out "Who’s There?". Unable to speak first,
Echo replied "Who’s There?" In time, Echo showed herself, professing her
undying love. However, heart still hardened, Narcissus would not accept
Echo’s love and shattered her affection to pieces. In response, Nemesis,
the god of hubris and vengeful fate, put a curse on Narcissus. That once
Narcissus looked upon a pond, he fell in love with his own reflection.
Unable to leave the pond, Narcissus withered away and died, and where
his body left, grew the Narcissus flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "Narcissism" now refers to people who love themselves more than
others, and the the story became an immortal symbol for self-propagated adoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t agree with this idea. &lt;strong&gt;My problem with this story, is
that the main theme isn’t self-adoration, but is the destructive
properties of beauty.&lt;/strong&gt; Dying of self-adoration is a fitting punishment,
yet, it isn’t the main point. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narcissus is a symbol of raw beauty in the world.  He is appealing to
the eye, and attains shallow raw admiration from all who he meets.
However, pride has captured his heart and that has numbed his senses
from being able to differentiate between shallow and deep affection.
Even in the sight of Echo, he is unable to distinguish between what is
true love. In greek, the word Narcissus is derived from Narke, which
means to sleep, or to be numb. &lt;strong&gt;The problem of those who have been
blessed with the gift of beauty, is their numbness to it.&lt;/strong&gt; The storys
ending treads a ominous path. It is only fitting that, unable to
understand the value of beauty, he fall victim to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the dilemma of unrequited narcissism. For those who have
fallen beyond the scope of beauty and aestheticism, they are yet just an
Echo, a clanging sound in the mist of an orchestra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From what I gain from this story, is a realization that we chase
dearly for beauty, yet not knowing how much it causes us to wither
away.&lt;/strong&gt; For those who play the role of Narcissus, humility is the key.
For those who play the role of Echo, it maybe time to re-evaluate and
move on. But for most of us, who resonate with both these characters, it
is important to realize these perspectives, and act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty if beauty’s own reward, however fulfilling it is dependent on
ones own decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of greek mythology, is that although it is
thousands of years old, we are still affected by these themes everyday.
Classic literature is soo inspiring, hopefully I’ll get to read more as
time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50th Anniversary of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;, we invite them to preform for us. They’re
popular, huge fan base of Asian-American as well every other ethnicity.
They proclaim to be making a revolution, a movement for Asian-Americans
in American pop culture.&lt;strong&gt;But without a doubt, I do not see style or
songwriting which distinguishes them from every other popular artist in
the industry. Of course, other than their ethnicity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation does not equal causation. Statistics will show that smarter
people usually own more books, but thats not to say owning books makes
people smart. So please, do not say, "I am an Asian-American, and I am
also a hit musician, ergo I am changing the social norm". Your logic is
wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Being a hit artist while carrying an ethnic stamp does not
change the industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; is a group of singers, songwriters and performers. But in these 3
categories, where do they excel? &lt;strong&gt;Can they sing like Bono? Can they
compose like Yo-Yo Ma? Can they perform like Michael Jackson or Ben Folds?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all industry changing musicians and songwriters. Their
excellence, distinguishes them from other musicians. &lt;strong&gt;The art they
create changes perception rather than acclaims to ones which already
have foundations.&lt;/strong&gt;With virtue of their talent and nature, they rose
to change the way music is perceived by the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the problem. Talent isn’t necessary to hit charts. "Like a
G6", hit charts at No.1 in 3 countries, while their new single
"Rocketeer", just hit charts recently. We listen to poetic garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from "Rocketeer"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby we can stay fly like a G6,
Shop the streets of Tokyo get your fly kicks,
Girl you always on my mind,
Got my head up in the sky,
And I’m never looking down feelin’ priceless, yeah,
Where we at, only few have known
Go on the next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, Cardio,
Til’ then let’s fly, Geronimo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensibly, it has no taste. &lt;strong&gt;Lyrically, its free form written slang with
poor grammar.&lt;/strong&gt; Poetically, the strings of lines are strung together to
make sure the last 3 lines rhyme. The first line is a reference to an
older song. Still, a G6 is a bad reference to a G5, which is the actual
plane. But I guess adding 1 to the plane number makes it better. The 5th
line is a reference to the master card commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, it’s not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; who is the problem. It is us. Why do we
resort to listening to this music. I bet most people didn’t even know a
G6 wasn’t a real plane, or even heard the badly placed mastercard
product placement. Does anyone know who Geronimo was, without doing a
quick wikipedia search. What we put in, is what we put out. I don’t
think "I like listening to catchy music" makes sense. When we don’t
consciously think about our music, we end up with mediocrity in the
industry.&lt;strong&gt;We demand "catchy", and so catchy is the new industry standard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might be harsh when I make these claims. But being a smart
consumer, of music, of products and of life is important. &lt;strong&gt;Music is
powerful.&lt;/strong&gt; Classes are being taught in universities about The Beetles
and social revolution. But that doesn’t mean we can relegate those times
to the history books. Because music continues to be a powerful medium of
education, information and social norms. &lt;strong&gt;We
can’t disillusion ourselves to think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; will do our job and change the
industry for us.&lt;/strong&gt; We change the industry ourselves, by seeing talent,
by making conscious decisions to empower our own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a hipster and stop yourself from listening to mainstream music.
But don’t just follow the crowd either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your own decision.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to music, which makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel really bad for this guy. He lost his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS3&lt;/span&gt;, and his girlfriend is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was walking towards the Starbucks on Costa Verde Plaza this early
afternoon, looking to fix myself on an early bout of a hot caffeinated
beverage. But while I was passing the bookstore, I saw a bald headed man
sitting down on his cell phone. After hearing his voice, I clearly
recognized the man, he was a medicinal chemist at Takeda
Pharmaceuticals, the place I had interned exactly one year ago. So I
looked over to him, and once he saw me, he politely finished his phone
conversation and headed in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name was John, and we were really close during my drug design
internship I feel like he was more of a mentor figure rather than a job
associates. We both shared similar enthusiasm for the sciences, and
would chat across the bench while prepping columns and setting up
reactions. Our conversations progressed through every avenue and subject
matter, from the inner workings of a pharmaceutical company to the
difference between Asian and American culture (lots of Japanese
scientists work at Takeda). However, in order to pursue my ambitions of
being a doctor, I decided not to continue working after my internship
period had expired. It was a bittersweet goodbye, but one in which I
needed to take. I didn’t want to be a scientist, I wanted to be a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him again, we reminisced of old times and filled each other on
life. Tomorrow, John would fly to Japan, to work at Takeda in Osaka. He
would be there for a year, and this being my last year at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;, the
chances of another random encounter would be slim. We chatted it up like
old times, and the conversation moved back and forth with ease. However,
at a moment in time, something interesting struck my mind. We were two
people, one following pursuits in medicinal chemistry, and another,
branching off into practical medicine, two different people, two
different paths, two different times, but yet having the same
conversation. The words were different, and the subject matter had
shifted, but on a macroscopic level, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it may seem unclear what I am trying to say, but please be patient
and let me expound upon this topic a little bit more. Afterwards, we had
to part ways, and I got my overpriced stock of coffee and moved into the
bookstore for some quick reading. While browsing through badly cataloged
magazine files, I saw the back of a magazine entitled "&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HBR&lt;/span&gt;". The first
thing that flashed in my mind was Bromic Acid, and I would be extremely
wrong to think so, it was "Harvard Business Review". But I had already
picked up the book, so I sat down and gave it a half hearted read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never interested in business. In fact, I had some pre-conceived
notions about people who were more business oriented, and in fact, a lot
of these biases were expressed while reading through the magazine.
However, I came upon an article which made me think again. The article
was entitled "Management is Not a Profession", and in it, the author
discusses the propensity of people to internalize their career not as a
commodity, but as their personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized from this article, is regardless of what people
specialize in, whether it is Business, Law, Medicine, Science etc.. From
reading a business article, I came to realize the extent to which we
compartmentalize. The propensity of generalize ourselves, others and
everything else in the world in order to understand it. However, it is
politically correct to make statements like "be yourself" and "love you
for who you are". Statements which offer an individual his/her own right
to be defined as himself and not the clothes on his skin or title near
his name. However, no matter how hard we try not to generalize, we
become enslaved by our own inability to understand without
simplification through demarcation. I am not a scientist, a doctor, but
I am a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

expectations, you end up hurting a lot. But then again, if your
expectations are easy, theres no fun in trying.&lt;/p&gt;

I met up with a friend who is
no longer here. It was just like the old days, and we just carried on
with our last conversation, as if we were still there at that time. It
stirred up old feelings which I had left ridden in the dust of my past
years. I embraced the nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like any other dream. You wake up, and thats what happened. I
woke up, and it was today. But unlike expectations, I wasn’t sad that it
was just a dream and not reality. In fact, I was happy. I was happy to
know that I had lived for a time, and I still have much to live for.
These memories make each day much more meaningful, and the memories to
come make each day worth looking foreword to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I miss you very much. I wonder when will be the
next time, we will be able to have a conversation like this.&lt;/p&gt;
