&lt;h2&gt;Anything you see below this is old&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="photoshoot" src="http://sanghan.me/img/photoshoot.jpg" style="width: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the end of 2011, I stopped blogging. I had created
a photography website using wordpress and was trying to
make a living as any recent graduate would. I chose photography
because I was good at it, and I had experience shooting with
some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nathanielkamphotography.com"&gt;professional photographers&lt;/a&gt;
in the san diego&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
However, I didn&amp;#8217;t go to school in photography, I had studied chemistry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But upon realizing the difficulties associated with work in science
with only an undergrad education, I chose photography. I was ultimately to
study medicine, and it was my 2nd attempt at that crazy application&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="chemistry" src="http://sanghan.me/img/chemistry.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
But something happened&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="new-job-new-world"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Job New&amp;nbsp;World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a job in Santa Barbara in engineering the next generation of
photonic switches. It was a real job, the technology was a relic lost during the
dotcom bubble, where many tech companies perished and crashed from the burst.
But now at resurgence of cloud computing and the demand of on the backbone
of the fiber-optic infrastructure some companies were starting to hire again.
It was something I believed in, information travling at the
speed of light through optical fiber, and was satisfying that itch
for uncovering new and novel ways of doing things, so I took the job and
didn&amp;#8217;t look&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve learned a lot. So I&amp;#8217;ve decided to start blogging again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightquanta"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LightQuanta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve decided to name this blog &lt;code&gt;LightQuanta.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
The equation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E_{photon} = h\nu - \varphi\)&lt;/span&gt; describes the particle nature of light quantized&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
But I&amp;#8217;m excited to start blogging again, and I hope you follow along!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
